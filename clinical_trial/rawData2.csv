1001,"Recruiting","Primary immune deficiencies (PID) are a group of chronic diseases characterized by recurrent infections. Apart from recurrent infections, in some of PIDs autoimmunity, allergy or malignancy could be accompanied to the diseases. Recently, the advanced sequencing technologies have led to the identification of a growing number of novel PIDs including the immune dysregulation syndromes caused by loss of function mutations in the LRBA (encoding lipopolysaccharide-responsive beige like anchor protein) and CTLA4 (encoding cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4) genes, which are in common associated with autoimmunity in addition to a predisposition to recurrent infections. PIDs with autoimmune components usually tend to have a more protracted clinical course and poorer prognosis rendering early diagnosis and treatment more crucial. The accurate diagnosis largely relies on the molecular diagnosis due to the significant overlaps between the phenotypic expression of these various genetic defects. The project aims to provide better and early diagnosis for LRBA, CTLA4 deficiencies by using basic and advanced immunological, genetic and molecular assays and rendering an early targeting therapy for patients, discover disease related new pathways and biomarkers that can be helpful during diagnosis and monitoring abatacept targeted therapy responses.","LRBA Deficiency|CTLA4 Haploinsufficiency","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","January 15, 2020","January 15, 2023","Abatacept Injection [Orencia]","Drug",,"All","60 Years","1 Year",,,"Turkey",,"30",,

Increasing aggressive activities of Th17 and Th1 cells that their function is to secrete proinflammatory cytokines and decreasing the number and activity of regulatory T cells, which normally leads to controlling inflammation, are seen in these patients.Many studies have carried out to assess the prevalence of Tregs and Th17 in autoimmune disorders such as MS. The Treg /Th17 functional balance is necessary for the impediment of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases by preventing harmful injury to the host and increasing effective immune responses. miRNAs have been shown to play a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various diseases including autoimmune or auto-inflammatory diseases. Curcumin, the active principle constituent of turmeric, is proved to be capable of regulating cellular responses and the growth of different cell types in the immune system such as B cells, T cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and natural killer cells. Curcumin has a combination of activities such as anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anti-proliferation, anti-invasive, and can used in the treatment of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Multiple sclerosis, Cardiovascular disease, Bacterial diseases and Arthritis. The solubility of curcumin in nanomicelles spherical water increases to more than 100 thousand times, which significantly enhances the absorption of curcumin.

Based on the timing of the infection neonatal sepsis has been classified into early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS), with differences in the mode of transmission and predominant organisms. EOS is defined as onset in the first 3 days of life generally due to vertical transmission of bacteria from mothers to infants during the intrapartum period. LOS occurs after 3 days of life and it is attributed to pathogens acquired postnatally (horizontal transmission). Considering generally neonatal sepsis in Europe, 90% of the responsible bacteria resulted to be: Streptococcus agalactiae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, e Listeria monocytogenes. The diagnosis is difficult because clinical signs, particularly early in the course of disease, are subtle and nonspecific, and laboratory tests and blood culture are not always reliable. Moreover. blood culture (considered the 'gold standard) takes 48-72 hours for result. In fact the cultural method requires the presence of living and vital germs, depends on the volume of the sample - serious problem in neonatal population -, several hours are needed to process the sample, possibly resulting falsely negative in subjects undergoing concomitant antibiotic treatment or a false positive result can be found by contamination. The method based on molecular biology does not require living germs and, therefore, is not characterised by the sensitivity limitations. Such method can result to be extremely effective in patients receiving antibiotic therapy.||In the present study, when an infant has to undergone blood sample for bacteria culture to verify a possible sepsis, a residual blood (200µl) is processed in the same time using a kit based on molecular biology.||This kit is designed to obtain the highest sensitivity and specificity in the determination of most invasive bacterial diseases (meningitis, sepsis, pneumonia, etc.) affecting full-term, preterm infants to determine any presence of bacterial DNA belonging to all serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes.||The target bacteria have been chosen on the basis of the current Italian epidemiological context, so as to include germs causing about 90% of the meningitis/sepsis cases among the neonatal population. The detection system can unmistakably identify the germ against which it is directed and without causing any cross-reaction with other germs or human DNA..||The results obtained with this method have demonstrated a 100% specificity (no false positive result) The sensitivity of this method compared with the cultural method has turned out to be twice as high.||The aim of the present study is to compare the efficacy of the blood culture method and the kit for molecular detection of bacterial DNA (all serotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Streptococcus agalactiae and Listeria monocytogenes) considering the relevant epidemiology of our NICU, in order to verify the relative frequency of sepsis (EOS and LOS) caused by the target bacteria on the whole frequency of the bacteria responsible of all the sepsis in our ward.","Sepsis","No","Observational","January 2015","June 2017","molecular assay|Blood culture","Diagnostic Test|Diagnostic Test",,"All","30 Days",,,,"Italy",,"69",,

1013,"Recruiting","Systemic amyloidoses are rare diseases affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 persons each year.||In systemic amyloidoses abnormal proteins deposit in bodily organs and severely impair their function, causing death if not treated effectively. Light chain (AL) amyloidosis is caused by a usually small population of plasma cells (the cells that produce antibodies). These cells produce part of antibodies, the light chains (LC) that form amyloid deposits. Almost every organ, with the exception of the brain, can be affected by AL amyloidosis. The heart is involved in three fourths of patients and is responsible for almost all the deaths occurring in the first 6 months after diagnosis. Current therapy of AL amyloidosis is based on drugs targeting the plasma cells producing the amyloid-forming LC. At present, most patients receive a powerful anti-plasma cell drug, bortezomib, as part of their initial treatment. However, bortezomib-based therapy, can improve heart involvement only in less than one third of patients with AL amyloidosis, and many patients (approximately one third) still die within 12 months from diagnosis. Early cardiac deaths remain an acute unmet need and the major determinant of overall outcome in this disease. Thus, there is the need of alternative means to treat heart involvement in AL amyloidosis. Doxycycline is a widely used, well tolerated, antibiotic that has been marketed for decades and used to treat a number of different infectious diseases caused by bacteria. This molecule has been extensively studied in the laboratory, in animal models and, more recently, in small studies involving patients, for its potential of improving cardiac damage in amyloidosis. These studies showed that doxycycline disrupts amyloid deposits, reduces the amyloid load in a mouse model, and counteracts the toxicity exerted by amyloid-forming LCs on C. elegans, a worm whose pharynx is used as a model resembling human heart. In a small clinical study, doxycycline was given to patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis during treatment for their underlying plasma cell disease. This resulted in a remarkable improvement of survival compared to ""matched historical controls"" (i.e. similar patients who had received only anti-plasma cell therapy without doxycycline in the past). Based on these promising preliminary results, we designed the present clinical trial to assess whether the addition of doxycycline to anti-plasma cell therapy can improve survival in patients with cardiac AL amyloidosis who were not previously treated. The rate of survival at 12 months will be compared in patients receiving doxycycline and in controls receiving standard antibiotic therapy, together with anti-plasma cell therapy. Patients will be assessed for parameters of plasma cell disease, heart involvement and possible involvement of other organs, as well as for quality of life. To make sure that patients who will receive doxycycline and those who will not have comparable severity of cardiac disease, patients will be stratified according to the stage of cardiac involvement. Patients with very advanced heart dysfunction will not be enrolled in the trial, because preliminary data indicate that doxycycline is of little or no benefit in these subjects. Patients will be randomized to receive doxycycline or standard antibiotics in combination with anti-plasma cell therapy. Bortezomib-based treatment directed against plasma cells will be delivered according to each participating institutions' guidelines. Doxycycline will be administered at a dosage of 100 mg two times a day, which is usual in the treatment of bacterial diseases. Standard antibiotics will be delivered according to each participating institutions' guidelines (provided that drugs of the same class as doxycycline are not administered) in the control arm. Patients will be provided a diary to record possible adverse events and will be instructed accordingly. Patients will be evaluated at trial centers every 2 months for treatment efficacy and toxicity. In case of unsatisfactory response second-line therapy will be initiated. In the absence of unacceptable toxicity, doxycycline administration will be continued for the entire duration of follow-up (12 months).","Cardiac AL Amyloidosis","No","Interventional","February 11, 2019","January 2022","Doxycycline|Standard of care therapy","Drug|Drug","Phase 2|Phase 3","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Canada|France|Germany|Greece|Italy|Spain|Turkey|United Kingdom","Randomized","120",,

Cytokines are small proteins that aract as e signals to other cells and are the way cells talk to one another. During cytokine release syndromesyndrome, too many cytokines are released and too many cells in your body react to their release. Symptoms resulting from cytokine release syndrome vary from flu-like symptoms to more severe side effects such as cardiac arrest, multi-system organ failure or death. We predict that about 50% of patients on this study will experience mild to severe cytokine release syndrome.||To help reduce cytokine release syndrome symptoms in future patients, a safety switch has been added to the ATLCAR.CD19 cells that can cause the cells to become dormant or ""go to sleep"".

1059,"Completed","This study is designed to evaluate a potential mechanism by which a hyperactive immune response may contribute to death from SARS-CoV-2; by an excessive neutrophil-mediated deposition of cell-free DNA in neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Excessive amounts of NETs can increase rigidity of mucus, clog airways, and be agents for the development of acute respiratory distress (Narasaraju et al., Am J Pathol. 2011). Many aspects of this pathway have been observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al., Respiratory research. 2020). Dornase alfa (DNAse I; Pulmozyme (Genentech) is a nebulized drug that works by degrading cell-free DNA and thus promoting airway clearance and recovery. The investigators hypothesize that by thinning mucus and degrading these NETs further lung damage may be prevented and a reduction in time to recovery may occur. The two aims of the study are to see if inhaled/nebulized dornase alfa will improve clinical outcome measures in SARS-CoV-2 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and to see if dornase alfa reduces the amount of bronchoalveolar lavage and blood markers of NET activity.||The study will recruit patients who are on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure related to SARS-CoV-2 positive infection and have ARDS based upon Berlin criteria.||The investigators aim to recruit 10-20 patients for this study.","SARS-CoV 2|ARDS","No","Interventional","June 19, 2020","December 31, 2020","Dornase Alfa Inhalation Solution","Drug","Phase 3","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","United States","Non-Randomized","30","4|11","4|10"

1065,"Recruiting","In light of the rapidly emerging pandemic of SARS-CoV-2 infections, the global population and health care systems are facing unprecedented challenges through the combination of transmission and the potential for severe disease. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) has been found with unusual clinical features dominated by substantial alveolar fluid load. It is unknown whether this is primarily caused by endothelial dysfunction leading to capillary leakage or direct virus induced damage. This knowledge gap is significant because the initial balance between fluid management and circulatory support appear to be decisive. On progression of the disease, bacterial superinfection facilitated by inflammation and virus related damage, has been identified as the main factor for patient outcome, but the role of the host versus the environment microbiome remains unclear.||The overarching aim of the present research proposal is to improve therapeutic strategies in critically ill patients with ARDS due to SARS-CoV-2 infection by advancing the pathophysiological understanding of this novel disease. This research thus focuses on inflammation, microcirculatory dysfunction and superinfection, aiming to elucidate risk factors (RF) for the development of severe ARDS in SARS-CoV-2 infected patients and contribute to the rationale for therapeutic strategies. The hypotheses are that (I) the primary damage to the lung in SARS-CoV-2 ARDS is mediated through an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response causing primary endothelial dysfunction, and subsequently acting two-fold on the degradation of the lung parenchyma - through the primary cytokine response, and through recruitment of the inflammatory-monocyte-lymphocyte-neutrophil axis. The pronounced inflammation and primary damage to the lung disrupts the pulmonary microbiome, leading secondarily to pulmonary superinfections. (II) Pulmonary bacterial superinfections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in COVID-19 patients. Pathogen colonization main Risk Factor for lower respiratory tract infections. To establish colonization, pathogens have to interact with the local microbiota (a.k.a. microbiome) and certain microbiome profiles will be more resistant to pathogen invasion. Finally, (III) Handheld devices used in clinical routine are a potential reservoir and carrier of both, SARS-CoV-2, as well as bacteria causing nosocomial pneumonia.","Corona Virus Infection|ARDS|Coinfection","No","Observational","April 9, 2020","December 31, 2023","Sampling (EDTA blood, pharyngeal and nose swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage ,urine)","Diagnostic Test",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Switzerland",,"300",,

Over 70% of the premature neonates who develop invasive candidiasis will die or suffer severe, permanent neurologic impairment. Fluconazole has been commonly used off-label in the neonatal intensive care unit, but definitive recommendations for its use in the nursery have been hampered by the limited number of well-designed trials. In neonates weighing <750 g, appropriate dosing is not known, definitive safety and long-term follow up trials have not been completed, and there have not been well-powered trials conducted to establish the efficacy of the product using mortality as part of the primary endpoint. Three recent proof-of-concept studies suggest that fluconazole will be safe and effective, and a recently completed pharmacokinetic study is providing data to give preliminary dosing guidance. The next logical step in drug development is proposed by this research: to conduct a pivotal trial to determine the safety and efficacy of fluconazole in premature neonates with 2-year neurodevelopmental follow-up assessment.||362 neonates, with a birthweight <750g, were randomized at 33 US centers, to twice weekly fluconazole (6 mg/kg) or placebo for the first 6 weeks of life.

If not treated properly typhoid infection can lead to severe complications and even death.||In this study the investigators aim to understand more about the S. Typhi bacteria and how S. Typhi causes a bloodstream infection after it has been ingested and passed into the gut. In spite of the extensive morbidity and mortality associated with bacterial blood stream infections (BSI), comparatively little is known about the pathogenesis. At a time of increasing antimicrobial resistance and a lack of new antimicrobial agents, understanding the pathogenesis of BSI is essential for efforts directed at prevention both of Salmonella Typhi and other bacterial species, particularly those that are restricted to humans.","Salmonella Typhi Infection","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","May 30, 2019","September 30, 2021","Salmonella Typhi challenge","Biological","Not Applicable","All","60 Years","18 Years","Basic Science","Single Group Assignment","United Kingdom","N/A","11",,

Vaginal and cervical tissue biopsies from women with BV will be obtained and infected OUTSIDE the body (ex vivo) with HIV.||BV is a vaginal infection that develops when there is an imbalance in the normal bacteria found in a woman's vagina. It is the most common cause of vaginal discharge among women of child-bearing age. BV infections potentially harm the safety of the tissue surrounding the cervico-vaginal region. When the cervico-vaginal tissue is not well protected, the risk of acquiring HIV from an infected partner might increase significantly. Studies have shown that HIV is more common in women with BV than in women with normal vaginal bacteria.||Treatment of BV typically involves the use of antibiotics. Antibiotics kill harmful bacteria and provide a temporary relief from the symptoms caused by the infection.

In an allogeneic bone marrow transplant procedure, bone marrow is taken from a healthy donor and transplanted into the patient. Bone marrow can be donated by a family member or an unrelated donor who is a complete tissue type match.||Participants will receive the chemotherapy and low dose radiation conditioning regimen consisting of the following: Fludarabine will be given intravenously for 5 days. Cyclophosphamide will be given intravenously on the first and second day. After completing the fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, patients will receive a single low dose of total body irradiation. The next day, patients will receive the allogeneic bone marrow transplant. On the third and fourth day after the transplant, patients will receive high dose intravenous cyclophosphamide. This is given to help prevent two complications: (1) graft rejection, which occurs when the body's immune system rejects the donor bone marrow, and (2) graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), which is when the donor immune cells attack the patient's normal tissues. On the fifth day after the transplant, patients will start receiving two additional medications: tacrolimus and mycophenolic acid (MPA, Myfortic), to help prevent GVHD. Patients will receive mycophenolic acid for about 5 weeks and tacrolimus for about 6 months. Also beginning on the fifth day after the transplant, patients will receive daily injections of a growth factor called granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), which is a protein that increases the white blood cell count; G-CSF will be continued until the patient's white blood cell count has returned to normal levels.||Patients will remain closely monitored either in the outpatient clinic setting or in the hospital for approximately 2-3 months after the transplant, but possibly longer if there are complications.

It is therefore advisable to use various medications and procedures to prevent or alleviate the occurrence of these sequelae and complications. Accordingly, there is a debate in the literature on the expedience of perioperative (prophylactic) use of antibiotics. It is interesting that numerous articles recommending perioperative (prophylactic) antibiotic use to patients undergoing the impacted mandibular third molar surgery may be found, as well as those providing arguments for the disagreement with such an approach, considering that its benefits do not outweigh the risks of adverse side effects, especially due to growing resistance of microorganisms towards antibiotics, which is a possible serious threat to global health. Concerning the perioperative (prophylactic) use of antibiotics for this indication, consensus has not yet been reached, and neither of the views has been verified by convincing scientific evidence. Having the aforementioned dilemma in mind, the main endpoint of the study was to determine the validity of perioperative (prophylactic) use of antibiotics as to alleviate customary sequelae and possible complications after surgical removal of impacted mandibular third molars and, at the same time, the effectiveness of newer antibiotics (moxifloxacin and cefixime) when used for this purpose. Moreover, microbiological investigations of susceptibility of the isolated microorganisms to antibiotics used in this research were performed, which could verify the clinically obtained results. With this in mind, two major contributions, based on scientifically verified results, could be expected from the research: (1) confirmation or refuting the validity of perioperative (prophylactic) antibiotic use to control sequelae or complications that could follow the impacted mandibular third molar surgery; and (2) confirmation of the efficacy of fluoroquinolones (moxifloxacin) and cephalosporins (cefixime) in controlling odontogenic infections.","Postoperative Complications|Antibiotic Reaction|Antibiotic Side Effect|Antibiotic Resistant Infection|Antibiotic Resistant Strain|Infection, Bacterial|Infection, Laboratory","No","Interventional","June 7, 2019","December 31, 2022","Moxifloxacin 400 mg Oral Tablet|Cefixime 400 mg Oral Tablet|Placebo","Drug|Drug|Other","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Serbia","Randomized","157",,

The tube is placed in the patient's trachea (windpipe) to assist breathing during and after an operation. Currently, breathing tubes in intubated patients are cleaned with a suction catheter that draws out secretions that accumulate in the tube. This method does not clean the tube completely, however, and within a few hours after the breathing tube is placed, bacteria may begin to grow inside the tube. Over time, as the patient breathes in and out through the tube, the bacteria may break free and enter the lungs, possibly causing pneumonia. In addition, the growth of bacteria in the tube decreases the size of the airway passage, making it more difficult to keep air moving in and out of the lungs.||Previous studies have shown that breathing tubes coated with silver-sulfadiazine prevented bacterial growth in the patient's airways and that use of the Mucus Shaver prevented accumulation of secretions in the lumen of the breathing tube, keeping the tube open. This study will determine if use of the coated tube and Mucus Shaver in patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation is safe and if it can reduce bacterial growth, the length of intubation and mechanical ventilation, the occurrence of pneumonia and the length of time in ICU and hospital.||Patients at San Gerardo Hospital who are 18 and older, who expect to have a breathing tube in place for more than 48 hours, and who are not allergic to silver-sulfadiazine may be eligible for this study.||Participants are randomly assigned to have either a standard breathing tube and standard cleaning or a coated tube cleaned with a Mucus Shaver.

The diagnosis and the early management are key issues that could improve the prognosis. In France, alcoholic cirrhosis is the leading cause of HCC, while the aetiology of underlying chronic liver disease is mainly hepatitis C (HCV) in Southern Europe and Japan, and hepatitis B (HBV) in Asia and Africa. In the next years, due to the improved results of anti-viral therapies, this trend should be reinforced with a decreasing proportion of HCC related to viral cirrhosis and an increasing proportion of HCC related to alcoholic cirrhosis. However, natural history of alcoholic cirrhosis remains poorly understood, most studies being retrospective and including a small number of patients. This project is filed by the consortium CIRRAL including French Academic hospitals centers currently involved and referees in the field of alcoholic liver disease and HCC (8 at the moment, and more in the next months). It is a national multicenter prospective study that will include 1200 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis histologically proven over 3 years.

1161,"Enrolling by invitation","Background||Bacterial Vaginosis is the most common vaginal infection in women in their reproductive years and a difficult one to treat. In the United States, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), estimated the prevalence of BV was 29 percent in the general population of women aged 14 to 49 years and 50 percent in African-American women. It is characterized by a shift in vaginal flora from an acidic environment due to acid producing lactobacilli to a mixture of anaerobic and facultative microorganisms. BV causes symptoms of vaginal odor, itching, discharge and irritation and can greatly impact a woman's health, quality of life, sexual relations, self-image and well-being. BV has also been associated with an increased risk of preterm labor, STD acquisition and vaginal cuff cellulitis after hysterectomy6. After treatment with antibiotics, recurrences are common. About 15-30% will have recurrence in 3 months7.||Normal vaginal flora is lactobacilli dominant. Lactobacilli maintain vaginal pH in the acidic range and keep the growth of BV associated bacteria at low levels. Lactobacilli also produce proteins with bactericidal activity which help to maintain their dominance. Anything that alters the vaginal flora and changes the pH to a more basic environment may increase the risk of BV.||Currently, there are many sexual lubricants and vaginal moisturizers available on the market. It has recently been shown that many of these are hyperosmolar and it is thought that hyperosmolar lubricants can be damaging to the epithelium and may alter the pH of the vagina. It is postulated that lubricants and moisturizers may predispose to BV by altering the pH of the vagina.||The Flourish Vaginal Care System, by Good Clean Love, includes the following three products:||Restore, a 510K-cleared moisturizing personal lubricant that has been on the market for 3 years. It is available without a prescription. It is formulated to bio-match the vaginal secretions of women with L. crispatus-dominated microbiota. Restore has a pH of 3.7 with racemic 1% lactic acid, and is iso-osmolar with serum. It is, therefore, much less likely to alter the acid base balance of the vagina, and therefore less likely to predispose to BV.||BiopHresh Vaginal Probiotic Suppository, a Bio Matched probiotic homeopathic formulation which provides a clinically-tested combination of lactobacilli including L. crispatus and other strains found in the most stable vaginal microbiome. Research has shown as many as 30% of women do not naturally produce these critical strains of lactobacilli.||Balance Moisturizing Personal Wash is a gentle, pH-balancing cleanser with soothing botanical extracts, formulated with more than 60% premium aloe. It is made without toxic saponifiers found in most bar soaps and OTC cleansers, which tend to disrupt the cell to cell adhesion barrier8.||The aim of this study is to determine if Flourish Vaginal Care System aids in re-establishing and maintaining a healthy vaginal microbiome by restoring the vaginal pH in to the acidic range. The healthiest vaginal environments are characterized by optimal acidic vaginal pH levels, the presence of specific strains of lactobacilli. The secondary aim is to determine if the continued use of Flourish will prevent recurrence of BV over a 6 month period. The third aim is to determine what the vaginal microbiome community state type is after 6 months of Flourish use.||This study is designed to be a pilot/feasibility study. The study will compare the subjects to a historical recurrence risk7. It will also assess the ability of subjects to comply with the protocol.","Bacterial Vaginosis|Vaginal Flora Imbalance","No","Observational","July 1, 2021","June 2022","Flourish Vaginal Care System","Combination Product",,"Female","52 Years","18 Years",,,"United States",,"40",,

A recent study suggests that a novel infection control bundle (IC bundle) can lead to a significant decrease in the incidence of CDI in acute-care hospitals. This IC bundle consists in screening patients for C. difficile carriage upon their admission combined with implementation of isolation precautions for carriers. Further investigations are required to confirm these findings.||Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of implementing a multicenter interventional study to further to investigate the efficacy of this IC bundle.||Methods: Prospective, cluster randomized feasibility trial of 2 infection control strategies (a ""standard"" and an ""experimental"" strategy) to reduce transmission of C. difficile among patients in 20 medical wards in 5 acute-care facilities in Quebec. Wards will be randomized (1:1) to one of the 2 interventions. Each intervention will be applied to all patients present on selected wards. The study will be divided into (1) a 3-month baseline period; (2) a 2-week randomization and implementation period; and (3) an 8-week intervention period.||Intervention: The ""experimental strategy"" includes the components of the above-mentioned IC bundle. The ""standard strategy"" will not implement the IC bundle.||Outcomes: As a feasibility study, process evaluation will form the primary and secondary outcomes. These outcomes will allow to determine whether a future main trial is possible and desirable.||Hypothesis: We hypothesize that the intervention will be implementable across the study wards.||Significance: This study is essential to plan a subsequent definitive trial to determine whether the IC bundle can prevent CDI.","Clostridium Difficile","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","August 25, 2017","May 2, 2018","Detection and isolation of C. difficile carriers","Other","Not Applicable","All",,,"Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Canada|Canada|Canada|Canada|Canada","Randomized","4138",,

This is attributed to prolonged ICU stay of critically ill patients with many co-morbidities. Modern medicine and multiple intervention make the patients susceptible to these prevalent moulds in the environment. In India the high frequency of IMIs in general has been attributed to environmental and host factors prevalent in this region. Additionally sub-optimal hospital care practice, frequent demolition and construction activities in the hospital make the patients susceptible to IMIs. There is no multicentric study available in India describing the epidemiology of IMIs in India. However, single center studies have reported distinct epidemiology of IMIs in India. High incidence, different spectrum and risk factors are possible unique features of IMIs in India.Early diagnosis and optimal therapy improve the outcome of these patients. The conventional diagnosis including histopathology and culture has limitations. The tests are of low sensitivity and long turnaround time. The major challenge is collection of sample from deep tissue. Therefore majority of the patients in ICUs of India are managed empirically against invasive fungal diseases. The galactomannan test has improved the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis. However, galactomannan test is not well standardized in non-neutropenic patients. Beta-glucan test is used for early diagnosis of invasive fungal infections other than mucormycosis. But the test is cumbersome for routine laboratories and expensive. Both tests are not available in majority of Institutions of India. PCR assay is not standardized and not performed routinely in any Institution.||Due these limitations in diagnosis, there is no uniform management protocol in ICUs of India. To develop optimal management protocol, we need to know the epidemiology, the right patient to treat, antifungal drug resistance, optimal drug and duration of therapy etc. The present study will provide descriptive epidemiology, present status of diagnosis and management practiced in India to treat IMIs in ICUs.

The majority of these infections were caused by Aspergillus species, which the first line of treatment is antifungal agent, Voriconazole , a triazole antifungal drug which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in May 2002 for the treatment of invasive aspergillosis and refractory infections of Scedosporium apiospermum and Fusarium spp. There are two forms of Voriconazole , oral and intravenous form. The recommendation dose is 6 mg/kg twice daily for two dosages, followed by 4 mg/kg twice daily in intravenous form or a loading dose of 400 mg twice daily for two doses is used (for individuals >40 kg), followed by 200 mg twice daily, and in individuals <40 kg the maintenance dose is 100 mg twice daily in oral form.||Voriconazole has a narrow therapeutic window and nonlinear pharmacokinetic profile with wide inter-individual and intra-individual variability, such as age, race, genotypic variation, liver dysfunction, the presence of food and drug-drug interactions with CYP450 inhibitors. These large variations in pharmacokinetics may be associated with decreased efficacy or increased toxicity. Therefore , monitoring of serum trough concentrations is recommended in the following infections: invasive aspergillosis treatment , endophthalmitis; meningitis or osteoarticular infections due to Exserohilum rostratum.||In Thai population , there are different genetic polymorphism from Caucasian ,resulting in a different response to the initial dose and there is limited resources in Thailand , mostly patients are unaccessible for Voriconazole level. Especially,in the period of starting drug, which is the critical period for patients ,most of them are post chemotherapy which may have gastrointestinal problems, mucositis , vomiting or diarrhea ,as well as receiving multiple concurrent medications. All of these affect drug absorption,drug level and efficacy of treatment. Thus, this study was designed to evaluated Voriconazole level in Thai patients in the first two week after administration.||Primary question||From the first collected of Voriconazole drug level , Are the invasive fungal infection patients in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital achieved the drug level more than 60% ?||Secondary question||Which factor affecting Voriconazole through level in the first two weeks after administration?||Research Design||Observational Studies (Descriptive retrospective and prospective study)||Research Methodology||Target Population||Patients received Voriconazole for treatment or prophylaxis invasive fungal infection||Study population||Patients in King Chulalongkorn Memorial hospital received Voriconazole for treatment or prophylaxis invasive fungal infection||Sample size||n= ZZ/2P(1-P) /dd||n = sample size|P =Incident rate|From the pilot study of 15 Invasive fungal infection patients in King Chulalongkorn memorial hospital from February to September 2015 , 60% ( 9 of 15 patients) of the first collected of Voriconazole trough level achieved the therapeutic level.||replaced P = 0.6||Z = 95% confident interval = 1.96|d = acceptable error = 0.10||n = (1.96) (1.96) (0.60)(1-0.60) / (0.10)(0.10)||n =92 , sample size = 92||Study processing and data collection||Data collection||Collected data of patients received Voriconazole in first two weeks of treatment or prophylaxis invasive fungal infection in King Chulalongkorn Memorial hospital in 2015-2017 from outpatient records , inpatient records and computer database in King Chulalongkorn Memorial hospital.

1306,"Completed","Invasive aspergillosis is a fungal infection which left untreated, is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Immunocompromised patient populations such as solid organ transplant and malignant hematology patients are especially susceptible to invasive fungal infections. Voriconazole is an anti-fungal agent that is frontline therapy for invasive aspergillosis. Treatment success is highly dependent on maintaining therapeutic voriconazole concentrations. The current published literature has established that treatment failure is associated with sub- and supra-therapeutic voriconazole concentrations.||Maintaining therapeutic voriconazole concentrations however, is challenging due to the high inter and intra-patient variability in voriconazole pharmacokinetics. The complex kinetics of voriconazole renders current manufacturers' dosing guidelines ineffective. Much of this complexity has been linked to genetic polymorphisms in the cytochrome P450 2C19 gene, and it has been found that CYP2C19 genotype plays an important role in determining voriconazole exposure levels. Therapeutic drug monitoring has been found to increase efficacy of voriconazole treatment through the monitoring of patients' voriconazole levels, allowing for dosage adjustments in response to supra- or sub-therapeutic levels.||There are few robust studies that have examined the effect of CYP2C19 genotype on voriconazole treatment outcomes. They have been unable to determine relationships between CYP2C19 genetic status, and clinical efficacy and safety. No studies to our knowledge have made dosing adjustments based on CYP2C19 genetic status.||The study aim is to explore the utility of voriconazole dosing that is based on the genetic status of the patient in conjunction with therapeutic drug monitoring. Over the course of one year, solid organ transplant recipients at Toronto General Hospital and malignant hematology patients at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre receiving voriconazole therapy will be randomized into one of two trial arms: a control arm receiving therapeutic drug monitoring only, or a treatment arm receiving genotype-specific dosing in conjunction with therapeutic drug monitoring. The investigators will compare the proportion of patients that achieve voriconazole therapeutic concentrations, the number of dose adjustments needed to achieve therapeutic voriconazole levels, and clinical outcomes between trial arms.","Aspergillosis Invasive|Fungal Infection","No","Interventional","January 10, 2018","August 28, 2020","Voriconazole genotype-specific dosing|Standard of Care","Genetic|Drug","Phase 4","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Canada|Canada","Randomized","30",,

This is a pilot clinical pharmacokinetic evaluation that will: 1) characterize the plasma concentration versus time profile of voriconazole in liver transplant patients receiving a fixed-dosing regimen to assess for extremes in systemic exposure 2) determine the oral bioavailability of voriconazole in liver transplant patients 3) assess for functionally significant allelic variation of the cytochrome P-450 enzymes that metabolize voriconazole (CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5) in both recipient blood and allograft tissue that may contribute extremes in systemic exposure among liver transplant patients. This evaluation will allow for an assessment of the adequacy of the prophylactic regimen in achieving therapeutic drug concentrations in all subjects. Additionally, the utility of genotyping as a clinical tool to identify patients at risk for extremes in voriconazole exposure will be evaluated.

1365,"Completed","Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality in Canada. It may be passed from a study participant colonized in the genital tract by GBS to their baby during vaginal birth. While approximately 10 to 30% of pregnant people harbour GBS in the vagina or rectum, the incidence of neonatal GBS disease is 1 to 2 infants per 1000 births. The use of intrapartum antibiotics to treat colonized individuals with or without risk factors has led to a 70% decline in the incidence of early-onset GBS sepsis in the past decade. Despite this impressive decline, antibiotic resistance has become a major public health concern. Association between intrapartum antibiotic use and ampicillin resistance in E. coli isolated from neonates has previously been documented. Furthermore, while GBS has remained sensitive to penicillin, 20% are resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin, which are alternate drugs for patients allergic to penicillin. Alternative approaches are therefore needed to reduce the risk of GBS infection.||We therefore propose to study the use of Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacillus reuteri RC-14 (Lactobacillus fermentum RC-14) in the colonization status of GBS in pregnant people. Lactobacilli are part of normal gut and vaginal flora and have been widely used as probiotics to treat various conditions. In particular, these two strains have shown to be beneficial in the treatment of urinary tract infections and bacterial vaginosis. Our study design involves recruiting two hundred pregnant people (one hundred in each arm) through various midwifery practices in the GTA at the end of their first trimester of pregnancy. These individuals will be randomized to receive probiotics or placebo for twelve weeks of their pregnancies and will be cultured before delivery to determine their colonization status.

1373,"Enrolling by invitation","The continuing spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-PE) is among the most important problems in antimicrobial resistance. It is also a good model to investigate the epidemiological complexity of resistance in Enterobacteriaceae. Available data on the transmission determinants of ESBL-PE in community settings are scarce, methodologically limited and mostly based on single centre studies. A comprehensive investigation using present typing and modelling techniques is warranted to develop a sound quantitative understanding of the interactions involved. A consortium of investigators with diverse expertise from countries with high and low endemicity of ESBL-EP has been created. Transmission and persistence of ESBL-PE within households and long-term care facilities will be studied. Individual and group-level determinants for transmission and persistence will be quantified, together with other ecological variables including environmental, food and wastewater contamination. Advanced molecular typing techniques and state of the art analytical methods will be used. Data generated in this project will directly inform a suite of mathematical models which, in addition to encapsulating current understanding of the processes, will be used to explore the potential effectiveness of different interventions to control ESBL-PE spread. The expected outputs are a comprehensive characterisation of ESBL-PE transmission considering bacterial clones and mobile genetic elements, as well as individual and ecologic-level factors in different settings, to inform public health authorities about interventions that should be prioritised to control transmission of these organisms.","Resistance Bacterial|Enterobacteriaceae Infections","No","Observational","March 1, 2017","February 29, 2020","ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae carriage","Biological",,"All",,,,,"France",,"160",,

By the end of April 2020, 3.08 million cases, and more than 214 thousand deaths were already recorded. The treatment so far has not been established and there are several clinical trials testing known drugs that have antiviral activity in vitro, due to the urgency that the global situation imposes. Medicines with specific actions can take years to be discovered, while a vaccine also takes a long time. Recently, it has been shown that the worsening of Coronavirus infection may be related to the formation of micro clots in blood vessels and anticoagulants have been used as adjuvants in the treatment. This study is justified by conducting a pilot study that showed an in vitro antiviral action (anti-COVID-19) of high molecular weight heparin. Methods: A phase I / II clinical trial will be conducted. 40 participants will be included in two arms. Participants allocated to Group 1 (control) will receive inhalation with 0.9% saline applied 4/4 hours, for 7 days.

Secondary outcomes will include length of hospital stay, length of intensive care stay, rate of reoperation and patient mortality. In addition, systemic vancomycin levels will be assessed at 6 hours and 20 hours postoperatively in each patient. Patients who have an external ventricular drain in place will have vancomycin levels assessed daily.

Decolonization strategies were shown able to reduce the rate of S. aureus infection in this category of patients although the risk of emergence of antimicrobial resistance persists. Approximately one quarter of the general population is colonized by S. aureus in the anterior part of the nostril (vestibulum nasi). Three main categories of nasal carriers have been historically identified: persistent carriers (20%, 12-30%]), intermittent carriers (30%, [16-70%]) and non-carriers (50% [16-69%]). By contrast to intermittent carriers and non-carriers, persistent nasal carriers have a higher risk of S. aureus infection, especially in continuous peritoneal dialysis and in orthopedic surgery.||Persistent carriers are characterized by a higher nasal bacterial load, a longer duration of carriage, a lower rate of exchange of S. aureus strains, and a particular affinity for the carried strain. However, there is no consensual definition of this persistent carriage state. In previous studies, 5 to 12 nasal sampling episodes were realized for a period ranging from 5 weeks to 8 years. The index of carriage, corresponding to the number of samples positive for S. aureus divided by the total number of samples, has been proposed to standardize the definition of the carriage state. According to standard tools, it is almost impossible to determine the nasal carriage state in routine practice.||Recently, an algorithm based on one or two quantitative cultures from nasal samples taken within 2 days that was able to distinguish accurately persistent and non-persistent nasal carriers of S. aureus has been described; only one nasal sample was needed in more than 9 cases out of 10. The aim of the present study was to assess prospectively the reliability of this algorithm in clinical practice in a cohort of healthcare workers (HCWs) and HPs and to check its ability for identifying patients with the highest risk of S. aureus infection","Staphylococcal Infections","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","October 2011","February 2013","Staphylococcus aureus carriage","Other","Not Applicable","All",,"25 Years","Diagnostic","Parallel Assignment","France","Non-Randomized","160",,

However, because of unsatisfactory eradication rate (80-85%), the Maastricht III guideline recommended extending the treatment duration to increase the eradication rate. Recently, levofloxacin (500 mg qd)-based triple therapy has been shown to achieve an eradication rate of 90% for both the first- and second-line treatment for H. pylori eradication. Several studies have demonstrated that high dose (750mg) and short-course (5 days) levofloxacin is as effective and well tolerated as traditional dose (500mg) and course (10 days) for treatment of mild-to-severe community acquired pneumonia. The high dose and short-course therapy has the potential to increase patient compliance and reduce bacterial resistance to fluoroquinolones. However, whether increasing the dosage of levofloxacin from 500mg to 750 mg qd can augment the efficacy of triple therapy in eradication of H. pylori and shorten the duration of therapy remains unknown. Although levofloxacin-based regimen was presumed to be more effective, previous reports pointed the concern that resistance to fluoroquinolone and other antibiotics which susceptible to the pumping efflux of bacteriae would increase among the gut flora.","Helicobacter Infections","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","June 2007","July 2009","Cravit based triple therapy|Klaricid based triple therapy","Drug|Drug","Phase 4","All",,"20 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Taiwan","Randomized","432",,

Unfortunately, recurrence rates of symptomatic BV remain extremely high, 30% at three months and 70-80% within a year. Given the paucity of information and data regarding pathogenesis of BV, the etiopathogenesis of recurrent bacterial vaginosis remains unknown. Accordingly, reliable, proven treatment regimens for Recurrent Bacterial Vaginosis (RBV) are not available.||In 2013, the investigators published two manuscripts documenting a new qPCR based approach to BV diagnosis and potentially prognosis. The method (LbRC) measures the content of lactobacilli in vaginal samples, relative to total bacterial load. The first goal of this study are to validate that this metric is a reliable diagnostic of BV, by determining sensitivities and specificities relative to Nugent scores and Amsel criteria of healthy women and BV patients. A high LbRC score (3-4) corresponds to a healthy state. The second goal is to determine whether empirically determined ""low"" LbRC scores (1-2) in BV patients after treatment are indicators of recurrence, and whether preemptive action, based on this score, with more intensive treatment, delays or eliminates recurrence in these patients.","Bacterial Vaginosis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","September 2014","March 2016","750 mg metronidazole/ 200 mg miconazole vaginal suppository|Standard of care","Drug|Drug","Early Phase 1","Female","55 Years","18 Years","Diagnostic","Crossover Assignment","United States","Randomized","200",,

Although the data to support this theoretical advantage is limited, many clinicians in Australia (and worldwide) use benzylpenicillin for therapy in this situation despite many international guidelines cautioning against this. This uncertainty is significant given that 1) S. aureus bacteraemia (SAB) is associated with a high mortality and significant morbidity, 2) S. aureus is one of the most common organisms isolated from blood cultures, 3) SAB is the most common reason for consultation with an Infectious Disease specialist (which itself has been shown to improve outcomes) and 4) a significant proportion (up to 20%) of SAB isolates in Australia will be reported as susceptible to penicillin, a proportion which appears to be increasing over the past 10 years in Australia and internationally.||Given the frequency of PSSA and the associated morbidity and mortality related to SABs in general, a definitive study to determine the optimal therapy for PSSA is required. In a recent survey of Infectious Diseases Physicians and Clinical Microbiologists in Australasia, 87% of respondents were willing to randomise patients to either benzylpenicillin or flucloxacillin for a clinical trial, whist 71% responded that they would switch therapy from flucloxacillin to benzylpenicillin for treatment of PSSA BSIs in clinical practice (unpublished data).||Therefore, the investigators see the opportunity to determine the feasibility of a definitive study comparing benzylpenicillin against flucloxacillin (or other ASP) for treatment of PSSA bloodstream infections.","Staphylococcus Aureus","No","Interventional","September 2018","July 2020","Benzylpenicillin|Flucloxacillin","Drug|Drug","Phase 4","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Australia","Randomized","60",,

1454,"Completed","The colonic microbiome is essential in human health and disease. Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), a highly morbid form of infectious diarrhea, is caused by antibiotics which perturb the microbiome and allow C. difficile to proliferate. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are powerful suppressors of gastric acid and among the most common medicines in the United States. Dozens of observational studies show that longterm PPI use is associated with CDAD. However, the mechanism by which PPIs cause CDAD is unknown. We believe that PPIs cause CDAD by inducing alterations in the human colonic microbiome. We will confirm or refute the hypothesized mechanism for the association between PPIs and CDAD using an unblinded, single-armed study design. We will use pyrosequencing of the hypervariable V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal subunit gene in human fecal samples to describe the colonic flora. We will collect fecal samples from volunteers before and after PPIs given for different durations and test the microbiome to determine 1) whether PPIs diminish overall diversity, 2) whether PPIs diminish relative abundance of Bacteroidetes, 3) whether increased duration of PPIs affects diversity, and 4) whether there is recovery of diversity after completing a defined course of PPIs. We believe that PPIs will cause a pattern of diminished overall microbiome diversity and reduced anaerobes - the same pattern seen after use of antibiotics. Furthermore, we believe that increased PPI duration will further diminish diversity and that the microbiome will return to pre-PPI levels of diversity after PPIs are stopped. These results will facilitate biologically-based clinical interventions to reduce rates of CDAD among patients who require acid suppression.","Clostridium Difficile","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","August 2013","March 2015","Omeprazole 40 mg bid","Drug","Phase 4","Male",,"18 Years","Basic Science","Single Group Assignment","United States","N/A","12",,

Healthy gut microbiota is known to prevent the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by pathogens, the so-called mechanism of colonization resistance, but this protective mechanism can be altered by therapies that impair gut microbiota, including antibiotics or chemotherapeutics, with consequent colonisation of gut pathogens, including multi-drug resistant bacteria (MDRB). MDRB carriers represent an epidemiological threat to other hospitalized patients and to the whole community, but are also at risk of developing clinical consequences of this colonization, including bloodstream infections from these pathogens. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) has shown high efficacy in the eradication of recurrent C. difficile infection, and initial evidence suggests that this procedure could be useful in eradicating also MDRB, mainly carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.||However, current evidence is mostly limited to case reports and case series, and to a single randomised trial, which was stopped early and did not draw clear conclusion. In a systematic review of 21 studies and 192 patients, eradication rates ranged from 0% to 100%, and authors concluded that larger, well designed randomised controlled trials are needed to further explore this therapy.||The aim of this study is to investigate the efficacy of FMT, compared with placebo FMT, in eradicating gut colonisation from MDRB, focusing on CRE. The investigators will randomize patients colonized by CRE (diagnosed by rectal swab) to FMT from healthy donors or placebo, by colonoscopy.

The discovery that most upper gastrointestinal diseases are related to H pylori infection and therefore can be treated with antibiotics is an important medical advance. Currently, a first-line triple therapy based on proton pump inhibitor (PPI) or ranitidine bismuth citrate (RBC) plus two antibiotics (clarithromycin and amoxicillin or nitroimidazole) is recommended by all consensus conferences and guidelines. Even with the correct use of this drug combination, infection can not be eradicated in up to 23% of patients. Therefore, several second line therapies have been recommended. A 7 d quadruple therapy based on PPI, bismuth, tetracycline and metronidazole is the more frequently accepted. However, with second-line therapy, bacterial eradication may fail in up to 40% of cases. When H pylori eradication is strictly indicated the choice of further treatment is controversial. When available, endoscopy with culture and consequent antibiotic susceptibility testing remains the most appropriate option for patients with two eradication failures to avoid a widespread use of expensive antibiotics. The use of these drugs may also induce severe side-effects and development of H pylori resistant strains.||Resistant strains of Helicobacter pylori can display a dense biofilm with mucus and microorganisms in a coccoid shape on the mucosal surface of stomach that may have a role in determining the resistance to the antibiotic therapies.

Here, investigators aim to explore the hypothesis that vaginal microbiota can be engrafted from one woman to another in a controlled clinical setting by using cervicovaginal secretions (CVS), a process referred to as vaginal microbiota transplant (VMT).","Bacterial Vaginosis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","March 2022","December 2023","Cervicovaginal secretions|Metronidazole gel|Screening tests|Activities restriction|Sterile Saline placebo","Drug|Drug|Diagnostic Test|Behavioral|Other","Phase 1","Female","45 Years","18 Years","Basic Science","Parallel Assignment",,"Randomized","45",,

1681,"Completed","The prevalence of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colonization and infections have been increasing in the general population, including the pediatric population. It has been reported that MRSA colonization persists for up to four years, and therefore the youngest pediatric patients, specifically those who are less than 2 years of age, have a high risk of prolonged colonization during a period of time when they are susceptible to significant skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs) attributable to MRSA. Once prolonged colonization takes place, recurrent SSTIs are commonplace, resulting in substantial morbidity and in some cases mortality, as well as a significant cost to the healthcare system. Individuals colonized with MRSA have an increased risk of developing MRSA infections, which range from mild disease, such as carbuncles, to severe infections, such as necrotizing pneumonia and toxic shock syndrome. The prevalence of severe MRSA infections is also greatest in neonates and infants, where increased MRSA colonization has been observed. In the early infant period, the most common manifestation of MRSA disease is pustular skin lesions, which affect approximately 5% of the general population, with MRSA-colonization being a major risk factor for this disease. Moreover, the prevalence of pustular disease is increasing in the general population, and there are numerous case reports of invasive, life-threatening MRSA disease in the early infant period.||Corresponding to the increasing prevalence in the community, the carriage of MRSA in pregnant women has also escalated, and vaginal carriage is significant in pregnant women. As an analogy, maternal vaginal Group B Streptococcal (GBS) colonization is the major risk for infant colonization regardless of whether early or late neonatal colonization or disease occurs. It is quite feasible that vaginal MRSA carriage predisposes newborns to colonization during the birthing process; however, this mechanism has not yet been well studied. There are other mechanisms implicated for early infant colonization, including close contact with MRSA-colonized mothers through daily care and breastfeeding. MRSA colonization in one household member greatly predisposes colonization in others; therefore, early infant colonization could result from contact with other MRSA-colonized individuals in a household. Currently, it is not clear which factors are the most important in influencing early infant MRSA colonization and subsequent infection.||Not only is the prevalence of MRSA colonization and infection on the rise, but there have been few if any measures that have been established to prevent colonization and subsequent infection in adults and children. Eradication measures have shown limited long-term benefit. If vertical transmission of MRSA can be established as a critical event in the pathogenesis of disease, potentially effective strategies could be tested, and possibly the spread of MRSA in the community interrupted.||Hypotheses and Specific Aims:||Identify the proportion, rate and time of MRSA colonization in infants born to mothers with and without MRSA colonization;|Compare risk factors for infant MRSA colonization in these two groups;|Determine the prevalence and risk factors for developing MRSA infections in the MRSA-colonized infant.","Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureus","No","Observational","June 2010","June 2012",,,,"All",,,,,"United States",,"100",,

1685,"Completed","Clostridium difficile causes ~453,000 infections and ~29,300 deaths per year in the US, making it the most common hospital acquired infection in the country. C. difficile is an anaerobic bacterium that has the capacity to inhabit the colon of humans and other mammals. Initially thought to be a commensal, it was later found to be associated with antibiotic induced enterocolitis. Since then, it has gradually become one of the most important healthcare associated pathogens. C. difficile infection (CDI) causes colitis, which is inflammation of the colonic mucosa with a spectrum of severity from mild to more protracted diarrhea, abdominal pain, fever, toxic megacolon, sepsis, and in some instances death. Mortality occurs despite the existence of three antibiotic options. CDI is also associated with higher hospital readmission rates, and associated healthcare costs in the US are estimated at 4.8 billion dollars annually. Due to the significance of C. difficile in healthcare, hospital level C. difficile rates are publically reported and closely scrutinized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid. Standard infection control bundles are proving to be insufficient for controlling the national C. difficile problem. Better understanding of the biological steps preceding clinical infection and reversal of the underlying gut dysbiosis will allow us to curtail our C. difficile epidemic. The present study aims to manipulate the gut microbiota to halt the biological progression of C. difficile.||CDI is a serious problem in hematology-oncology patients. The incidence of CDI in the hematology-oncology population is much higher than in other populations and hematology-oncology inpatient units frequently have the highest incidence of CDI cases within an institution. Additionally, hematology-oncology patients have high rates of C. difficile colonization upon hospitalization and more than 50% of patients detected with C. difficile colonization before bone marrow transplantation end up diagnosed with hospital associated CDI. This finding is not trivial as CDI treatment with oral vancomycin causes major and prolonged perturbations of their intestinal microbiota, which has been associated with higher mortality. In addition to the usual complications of CDI, a higher incidence of graft-versus-host-disease has been described in patients with CDI.","Clostridium Difficile|Hematologic Diseases","No","Interventional","June 1, 2019","August 1, 2021","Potato starch","Dietary Supplement","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Prevention","Single Group Assignment","United States","N/A","8",,

The procurement strategy will involve issuing each isolate a temporary strain designation number which will be destroyed once the antibiotic profile of the isolate has been confirmed at MRL, thus preventing any link to the data generated by the site. The isolate and its antimicrobial susceptibility profile to several key drugs will be recorded in the NARSA Repository database.

There is an urgent need for targeted and effective COVID-19 treatments which has put great pressure on researchers across the world for developing effective drugs. This paper reviews the possibility of using Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 Receptors -Like Enzyme of B38-CAP to treat SARS-CoV-2 based on the intracellular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and consequences caused. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology, and it's being currently being investigated as a potential covid-19 and acute lung failure treatment through several clinical trials.. The SARS-CoV2 binding site was identified as ACE2, a part of the RAAS, which is known to protect the lung from injuries. it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II activity leading to inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, as well as pulmonary vasoconstriction, which can lead to acute lung injury.. Therefore, treatment with recombinant soluble ACE2 protein and drugs that up regulate ACE2 may alleviate pulmonary complication. In animal models including heart failure, acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy, recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhACE2), which is devoid of its membrane-anchored domain thus soluble, has been shown to have beneficial effects. Despite its positive effects, rhACE2 is a glycosylated protein, which necessitates a time- and cost-intensive protein expression system using mammalian or insect cells, which may be inconvenient in drug production and medical economics. Moreover, we hypothesis that treating COVID-19 patients with recombinant soluble ACE2 protein may induce autoantibodies and T cells to cellular ACE2.Furthermore, rhACE2 may interact with spike protein based vaccine and worsen its effect . These autoantibodies may generated by enforced presentation of the soluble Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in a complex with COVID-19 Spike protein in fragment crystallizable (FC) Receptor positive Antigen Presenting Cells in the blood The development of autoantibodies might make injury and damage to the host epithelial cells and hamper their ACE2 dependent function in lungs, intestine and testes which express ACE2. In addition to inducing platelet aggregation and thrombosis . Although it has been stated that immune response associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this was not the case with B38-CAP; no antibodies against B38-CAP were detected in the serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for two weeks... In this case we suggest that bacterial engineering could be used to develop better protein drugs for COVID-19 treatment... B38-CAP is an ACE2-like enzyme derived from bacteria that reduces hypertension and cardiac dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology, and it is currently being studied in clinical trials to treat acute lung failure. In mice, B38-CAP treatment prevented angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. B38-CAP is an ACE2-like enzyme derived from bacteria, demonstrating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase (B38-CAP) to a human ACE2-like enzyme. As a result, we think that treating COVID-19-infected patients with Bacterial ACE2 like enzymes, rather than human ACE2, may be preferable because it will perform the same role as human ACE2 and may not be recognized by COVID-19 spike protein||Keywords: COVID 2019 ,Infection, B38-CAP , Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme , rhACE226.","COVID-19","No","Interventional","July 2021","October 2021","Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP (rbACE2)","Drug","Phase 1","All","80 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment",,"Randomized","24",,

CA-MRSA strains are usually distinguished from their HA-MRSA counterparts by the following characteristics: Firstly, CA-MRSA strains are usually susceptible to non-lactam antibiotics. Secondly, CA-MRSA harbors type IV and V SCCmec elements, which are shorter than the traditional type I, II, and III SCCmec elements found in HA-MRSA strains. Thirdly, certain successful clones are associated with outbreaks of CA-MRSA infections reported in specific geographical locations. For example, ST1 and ST8 isolates are mostly reported in the USA and Canada, ST80 isolates are commonly found in Europe, and ST59 isolates are encountered in the Asia-Pacific region. Notably, all these characteristics have substantial limitations for discriminating CA-MRSA isolates due to their complex backgrounds. Although there were more and more studies of CA-MRSA in European countries and the US, few national epidemiological data were available about China.

1877,"Not yet recruiting","Most of the methods involved in the treatment of BV include antibiotics. Some of the antibiotics used for this include metronidazole, clindamycin and fluconazole. The antibiotics inhibit the growth of anaerobes that support G. vaginalis and other microbes without affecting lactobacilli. This leads to the treatment of BV while also preventing its recurrence. However, the use of antibiotics may lead to antibiotic resistance and cause various side-effects such as thrush, dizziness, rash, nausea, etc. In the case of many antibiotics, the cure rates were incredibly poor and the BV recurrence rates reached as high as 80 %. Probiotic therapy has slowly been replacing antibiotics for the treatment and prevention of BV and other infections. These probiotics usually contain lactobacilli and help maintain a healthy vaginal environment. They can either be consumed through curd and other milk products that contain probiotics (mostly lactobacilli) or they can be used in the form of suppositories that are placed in the vagina. In probiotics containing lactobacilli, the lactic acid produced by the bacteria lowers the vaginal pH to the ideal range of 3.5 to 4.5 and prevents infection recurrence. Lactobacilli containing suppositories have been successfully used in the past to treat BV, being marketed as a safe and effective way to prevent and treat infections for women in various stages of their lives.","Bacterial Vaginosis","No","Interventional","September 25, 2021","July 12, 2022","Lactobacillus Species|Placebo","Drug|Other","Phase 4","Female","65 Years","40 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","India|India|India","Randomized","75",,

Biofilm samples were collected from the prostheses and palate in the baseline, after 7 and 37 days of use of the solutions and seeded in CHROMagar Candida medium. After incubation period, the presumptive identification, incidence verification and quantification of Candida species growth (CFU count) were performed. To quantify biofilm with software ImageTool 3.0, the inner surface was disclosed (1% neutral red) and photographed at the end of each period. The Candidiasis remission was assessed by scores before and after the use of solutions by palate's phographs. Descriptive analyzes were used for the identification and incidence of Candida spp. Kruskal-Wallis and Friedman tests, with stepwise step-down post-test for cell growth; ANOVA and Tukey for biofilm removal; Frequency of scores for evolution of inflammation. Level of significance was 95%. The most incident species were C. albicans, followed by C. tropicalis, C. glabrata and C. krusei. HS 0.25% reduced the incidence of the three species on the prostheses and palate in the periods of 7 and 37 days; CT 0.5% promoted reduction of Candida spp. only in dentures. R. communis decreased the incidence of C. tropicalis in both collection sites. For CFU counts, HS 0.25% and CT 0.5% caused significant reduction.

1888,"Completed","Although the clinical outcome in patients with Invasive Aspergillosis (IA) is largely dependent on early initiation of effective treatment with antifungal drugs, diagnosing IA is still a critical problem. Symptoms are non-specific and available diagnostic tools are either invasive or have low sensitivity and specificity. This often results in a diagnostic delay, with patients developing more extensive disease. Furthermore, as long as IA is present, oncological follow-up treatment is not feasible. Inaccuracy in diagnosing IA can cause serious treatment delay and increased mortality. However, an empirical strategy with prophylactic anti-mould therapy is not feasible considering both possible side effects and costs. In order to safely continue the use of a pre-empirical strategy, improved (non-invasive) diagnostic tools are desirable.||In a pilot study de Heer et al. showed that it is possible to discriminate between patients with IA and their neutropenic controls by exhaled breath analysis using an electronic nose (eNose). In this study the investigators aim to test whether an eNose could be useful as a diagnostic tool in a prospective setting.||The gold standard in exhaled breath analysis is Gas Chromatography - Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS). This technique enables identification of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in breath of patients. It is possible that there are Aspergillus specific VOCs in the breath of patients with IA.||The composition of the lung microbiome seems to be an important factor in both health and disease. It is likely that the microbiome of the lung changes in prolonged neutropenia, therefore possibly creating a niche for molds and yeasts. Comparing the microbiome of patients with prolonged neutropenia who develop IA with those who do not, can learn us more about the pathogenesis of this disease. This knowledge could be used to investigate new treatment options for Invasive Aspergillosis.||Hypothesis The investigators hypothesize that airway microbial (viral, bacterial) presence and exhaled molecular profiles as obtained from patients with prolonged neutropenia due to treatment of hematological malignancies, are different between patients who develop IA and patients who do not.","Invasive Aspergillosis","No","Observational","December 2012","March 2017",,,,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Netherlands|Netherlands",,"120",,

1929,"Unknown status","The incidence of invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is increasing in all parts of the world. Despite introduction of new antifungal agents for prophylaxis and treatment of IPA in the last decade, the outcome of patients with IPA is still unsatisfactory and needs improvement. Particularly, recent developments in diagnostic imaging, including introduction of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) into standard procedures, made a place for improvement of diagnosis of IPA.||Computed tomography of the chest is the optimal, recommended imaging procedure for diagnosis of pneumonia in febrile neutropenic patients and it is significantly superior to conventional chest X-ray. However, the method is associated with some difficulties mostly due to the broad spectrum of pathological findings in patients with IPA and their evolution over time. This has been described in retrospective studies on relatively small groups of patients. Prospective studies on larger populations are still missing, as well as studies on combination of different diagnostic modalities e.g. diagnostic imaging and microbiology.||We recently published the results of the clinical trial: ""A Phase II Dose Escalation Study of Caspofungin in Patients with Invasive Aspergillosis"" which used caspofungin doses of 70 to 200 mg daily for the first line treatment of IPA. The maximum tolerated dose was not reached, but response rates were impressive with complete plus partial responses accounting for 54.3% and overall mortality at 12-week follow-up as low as 28.3%. There was a tendency towards higher doses yielding higher response rates.||For the majority of these patients we obtained serial chest CT. So, for the first time a patient population is at hand, in which the kinetics of infiltrates over time can be described.||The main objective is to describe the pathological findings in chest CT performed sequentially in IPA patients while receiving effective antifungal therapy. The specific objectives are:||Characteristics of pathological findings in sequential chest CTs||To describe the pathological findings (e.g. halo sign, air crescent sign and air consolidation) in sequential high resolution computed tomogrphy (HRCT) examinations|To calculate the incidence of individual pathological findings in sequential CT examinations|To calculate a total volume of fungal infiltrates in sequential CT examinations||Correlation of pathological findings in sequential CT with corresponding white blood count (WBC) and absolute neutrophil count (ANC)||To correlate the appearance or disappearance of individual pathological findings with WBC and ANC|To correlate the volume of fungal infiltrates in sequential CT examinations with WBC and absolute neutrophil count||Correlation of pathological findings in sequential CT with the serum galactomannan index||To correlate the appearance or disappearance of individual pathological findings with the serum galactomannan index|To correlate the volume of fungal infiltrates in sequential HRCT examinations with the serum galactomannan index||Correlation of pathological findings in sequential HRCT with outcome of IFI||To correlate the appearance or disappearance of individual pathological findings with outcome of IFI|To correlate the volume of fungal infiltrates in sequential HRCT examinations with outcome of IFI","Invasive Aspergillosis",,"Observational","June 2013",,,,,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Germany",,"40",,

There have been outbreaks of MRSA infections at prisons and jails. We will study the spread of MRSA in the jail to better understand how the bacteria are transmitted from person to person there and how we can prevent their transmission. All detainees asked to participate must give informed consent to do so; their privacy will be carefully protected. Detainees with a history of allergy to CHG will be excluded. Seventeen objects in the jail will be sampled for contamination with MRSA. Bacteria will be collected from all cultures obtained from patients with bacterial skin infections for 18 months in a part of the jail in order to determine how frequently these infections are caused by MRSA relative to other bacteria. A group of about 1500 adult detainees will be tested for colonization with MRSA in order to determine how commonly detainees carry the bacterium. A cluster-randomized 6-month study will be undertaken among these detainees and those who take their places when they leave the jail to determine if chlorhexidine (CHG)-containing disposable wash cloths for skin cleaning can decrease the prevalence of MRSA skin or nose colonization. Detainees receiving CHG cloths (about 500 detainees) will be compared to detainees receiving water-soaked cloths for skin cleaning (about 500 detainees) or no intervention (about 500 detainees). The primary outcome will be a difference in average colonization prevalence in detention tanks, which are discrete detention units housing detainees, comparing the usual care to the CHG-exposed tanks after 6 months of CHG cloth use. A secondary outcome will be a decrease in skin infections from any cause in the tanks receiving CHG compared with usual care.

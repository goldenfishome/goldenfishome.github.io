6035,"Not yet recruiting","Insulin resistance is defined as a decrease in the ability of insulin to lower blood glucose levels. Various pathological conditions can cause an increase in insulin resistance, such as sepsis, administration of certain medications, various stressful situations, surgery or significant injuries, etc. Sepsis can cause extreme stress, which causes significant changes in metabolism, disruption of blood glucose regulation and increased insulin resistance. In sepsis there is an extreme activation of inflammatory mediators and of counter-regulatory hormones, such as cortisol, glucagon and catecholamines, which increase hepatic gluconeogenesis on the one hand, and increase the peripheral resistance to insulin on the other hand.||Disorder in the regulation of blood glucose level causes increased mortality and morbidity among intensive care unit patients with sepsis, as well as an increase in the duration of hospitalization and its financial expenses.||There are a number of parameters used in the intensive care unit to diagnose the development of sepsis within the unit, such as an increase or decrease in body temperature, an increase in CRP level, white blood cell count, pro-calcitonin level, etc It is possible that an increase in insulin resistance can also be used as a predictor of sepsis. It should be noted that almost all patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit are treated with a continuous infusion of insulin to balance their blood glucose level, including patients who are not diagnosed with diabetes prior to their hospitalization in the unit. This is in light of the increase in insulin resistance for the reasons listed above among patients in critical condition, and also due to the need to maintain blood glucose values in the range of 140-180 mg/dl, since high blood glucose values among patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit are associated with increased morbidity and mortality.||We would therefore like to investigate whether an increase in insulin resistance, as expressed in an increase in the patient's insulin intake, can predict the development of sepsis secondary to bacteremia in the intensive care unit.","Acquired ICU Bacteremia","No","Observational","December 2021","August 2025",,,,"All","99 Years","18 Years",,,"Israel",,"50",,
6036,"Completed","Sepsis is a life-threatening disease caused by a dysregulated host response to infection. This can lead to organ-dysfunction and septic shock, which is a subset of sepsis where underlying abnormalities increase mortality remarkably. Blood cultures are the gold standard for identifying pathogens in the bloodstream (bacteremia). It is based on cultivation techniques which, theoretically, can detect a single pathogenic cell from a patient sample. However, blood cultures have serious limitations, such as long time to result (3-7 days). This leads to the fact that only a small fraction of the patients obtain a correct diagnosis and in further consequence get the optimal antimicrobial treatment. Patients with sepsis should get antimicrobial treatment within the hour. Thus, physicians start treatment empirically, with broad-spectrum antibiotics. This puts a selective pressure on pathogens and has led to an increased amount of antibiotic resistance. Faster diagnostics are necessary to ensure an immediate and targeted treatment. In the EU-funded FAPIC project, two diagnostic systems that can be used with direct sample material from patients will be developed, avoiding the time-consuming cultivation of pathogens.||In this study, the evaluation of the rapid diagnostics will be performed in patients with sepsis, suspected of bacteremia. To this aim, the performance of the diagnostic systems will be evaluated using blood samples that are collected in parallel with blood cultures. In addition, clinical data of the patients will be collected. In routine care, two blood culture sets (2x2 bottles) per patient are collected. One extra blood samples (EDTA, 9 ml) will be sampled with each blood culture set, totaling 2 samples per patient. In this study, patients presenting at the Emergency Department (ED), and the department of infectious diseases/nephrology will be included. The results will be used to estimate the performance, sensitivity, and specificity of the diagnostic systems compared to blood culture. Furthermore, in order to determine the severity of sepsis and to describe the patient population, clinically relevant parameters and laboratory parameters (ferritin, HLA-DR, serum lactate, SOFA score) will be assessed to determine its association with severity of disease and patient mortality. Evaluation will be done exclusively in the lab, and will not be used directly for the diagnosis or management of patients.

Patients, especially those on chronic medication therapy, inevitably miss doses. They use too little or too much therapy. They may take medications too soon or too far apart. While adherence to injection treatments tend to be better than adherence to topical or oral treatment, adherence to injections may still be poor.||Traditional methods for measuring medical adherence-including questionnaires, surveys, and diaries- tend to be unreliable overestimate adherence. Chemical markers are problematic because of the tendency for patients to use their medication right before visits, so called ""white coat compliance."" Our research team has pioneered the use of electronic monitoring devices which measure and record the date and time of medication events to assess adherence in dermatology. The study team have demonstrated the feasibility of using such monitors to measure adherence to adalimumab in patients with psoriasis. Although only a small study, it documented a broad range of how patients use adalimumab and found that adherence was poor in about half of the patients. While the impact of psoriasis on patients' lives is large, adherence is still poor.

6156,"Not yet recruiting","The goal of open extremity fracture (OEF) treatment is to promote fracture healing and restore function while preventing the development of infection. This is achieved through systematic and timely wound debridement and irrigation, fracture stabilization, tetanus prophylaxis, systemic and local antimicrobial therapy, and judicious timing of wound closure based on cleanliness. Early prophylactic systemic antibiotics lower infection rates in open fractures but have limitations of achieving adequate concentration at the hypoperfused wound area. OEF wounds are frequently poor in vasculature secondary to the soft tissue injury, hence adequate concentration of antibiotic cannot permeate to the tissue at risk. If systemic antibiotic concentrations are increased to achieve minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for pathogens at the wound, there is heightened concern for systemic drug toxicity. In sharp contrast, locally administered antibiotics achieve high drug concentration directly within the wound cavity with minimal systemic side effects. Local antibiotic therapy has shown to reduce rates of open fracture wound infection. With the serious implications of postoperative infections in OEF, it is imperative that all measures including further use of prophylactic local antibiotics be considered to prevent fracture-related infection (FRI). The overarching hypothesis for this project is that a novel synergistic combination of local aqueous tobramycin plus perioperative weight-based IV cephalosporin antibiotic prophylaxis will reduce the rate of FRI one year after OEF surgery. This in turn will improve OEF patient outcomes, decreasing morbidity and return to the operating room (OR) without any adverse effect on fracture healing. Regardless of the treatment group, bacterial speciation will be determined for patients that do develop FRI to help guide future treatment.

6163,"Recruiting","Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a common chronic skin disease where patients experience inflamed painful nodules and chronic suppurating tunnels under the skin that often leave mutilating scars. Symptoms typically begin during adolescence and patients struggle with pain, pruritus, malodor and purulent discharge compromising work life, physical exercise, and sexual habits. Consequently, the risk of social exclusion, anxiety, depression, and suicide is increased among patients suffering from HS.||Creams, tablets, and injections aim to gain disease control, yet are sometimes not sufficient. Once HS tunnels have formed, surgical intervention is often required.||Recently, emergence of flexible diode laser fibers has enabled treatment of tunnels from within. The technique has been tested for perianal tunnels and in few studies also for HS tunnels with promising results. Overall, the laser fiber technique is still new, and knowledge of optimal treatment settings is sparse. However, there is reason to believe that intralesional laser fiber treatment of HS tunnels may provide a new tissue-sparing alternative to conventional surgical techniques with a potential to produce fewer side effects, less scaring, shorter downtime after surgery and possibly, also improved inflammatory control.||This study aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of laser fiber treatment of HS tunnels.||Method The project is carried out at the Dermatological Department, Roskilde University Hospital under the leadership of principal investigator Professor DmSc Gregor Jemec.||A prospective cohort study of intralesional laser fiber treatment of HS fistulas is planned.||After signing informed consent, patients with two comparable HS tunnels in typical areas will draw lot to receive experimental laser fiber treatment of one tunnel while the other tunnel serve as control. Efficacy will be monitored by pain scores, ultrasound, clinical photos, clinical measures of disease activity, quality-of-life scores, and skin biopsies. Patients will be followed 2, 6, 12 weeks and if possible, also 52 weeks after treatment.

Since then, COVID-19 has spread worldwide and is responsible for an unprecedented pandemic with major threat on global health and social and economic stability.||Covid-19 has a large spectrum of symptoms. Most patients experience mild or moderate flu-like disorder with cough, fever, and shortness of breath. More severe presentations may occur; patients sometimes develop an acute pneumonia that can lead to adult respiratory distress syndrome. A considerable number of publications have been released for the last 10 weeks to help physicians making diagnosis and treat patients. Chinese authors have extensively proposed description of the disease. As signs and symptoms are poorly specific, diagnosis mostly relies on detection of the virus by RT-PCR in the upper respiratory tract. Some uncommon images and localization are highly specific and sensitive on chest CT-scan, which is cornerstone for initial diagnosis. However, resources may lack during healthcare crisis and results of these investigations may be delayed or unavailable developper. Special attention should also be paid to usual laboratory analysis. Indeed, decreased lymphocytes and eosinophilic counts are frequently described as well as increase in D-dimers levels. Variation of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) have been reported. Coronavirus may have cardiac tropism and changes in cardiac biomarkers concentration may occur. Therefore, some data suggest that values of routine biomarkers and blood cell count may assist physicians at bedside to support diagnosis of COVID-19.||To face the outbreak, organization of emergency departments (ED) was mandatory to separate patients flows and avoid mixing patients with COVID-19 and others. Most patients visiting EDs dedicated to initial COVID-19 management suffered of pneumonia-like symptoms. Despite initial triage, patients had either COVID-19-related pneumonia either alternative diagnoses. We took advantage of this to evaluate the ability of routine biomarkers and leucocytes count helping identification of COVID-19 from alternative diagnoses.","Covid19",,"Observational","February 1, 2020","May 15, 2020",,,,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Monaco",,"257",,

The identification of the causative pathogen is crucial for an early optimization of the antimicrobial treatment regime in patients with sepsis. In this context, culture-based diagnostic procedures (e.g. blood cultures) represent the standard of care, although they are associated with relevant limitations. Therefore, culture independent methods (e.g. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)) seem to be an attractive alternative. By the identification of circulating cell-free DNA in the blood and the use of the quantitative sepsis indicating quantifier (SIQ) score, causing pathogens can be identified and potential contaminations can be excluded.||The goal of the presented study is therefore, to assess the diagnostic performance of a NGS-based approach for the detection of relevant infecting organisms in a big cohort of septic patients (n=500). Moreover, the plausibility of this NGS-based approach will be estimated by a panel of independent clinical specialists, retrospectively identifying potential changes in patients´ management based on NGS results.","Sepsis|Septic Shock","No","Observational","March 1, 2019","December 31, 2021","Next-Generation Sequencing","Diagnostic Test",,"All","99 Years","18 Years",,,"Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany|Germany",,"500",,

The hypothesis that respiratory infections are linked to an imbalance of the nasopharyngeal microbiota has recently emerged and some studies show a link between the respiratory microbiota, the susceptibility to viral respiratory infections and the severity induced. In a preliminary work on the respiratory microbiota from 225 patients and 48 controls, the investigators found a decrease in the richness and biodiversity of the nasopharyngeal microbiota in patients with a respiratory viral infection as well as an enrichment of their respiratory flora in pathogenic bacteria.||Interestingly, these recent years, the development of qPCR for virus diagnosis showed a substantial proportion of asymptomatic carriers of viruses suggesting that the nasopharyngeal microbiota may play a critical role in the genesis and clinical expression of viral respiratory infection, challenging Koch's postulate.||The principal objectives of this study are to compare the respiratory microbiota between symptomatic patients with respiratory viral infection and asymptomatic carrier of virus. The aim is to determine the existence of respiratory microbiota profiles associated with the occurrence of viral respiratory infections influencing the clinical expression of virus and to determine the role of the respiratory microbiota in the occurrence of bacterial superinfection which will justify an early antibiotic treatment.||The investigators will include 35 symptomatic patients with viral respiratory infection harboring positive qPCR for respiratory virus (influenza A or B, RSV, rhinovirus, metapneumovirus), 35 asymptomatic patients with positive qPCR for respiratory virus and 30 healthy subjects (controls).

The most common symptoms related to this disease are fever, cough, dyspnea, myalgia, headache, diarrhea and rhinorrhea. COVID-19 is characterized by immune system dysfunction and hyperinflammation causing acute respiratory distress syndrome, macrophage activation, and coagulopathy. The clinical course for SARS-CoV-2 in most cases is mild, but approximately 14% of cases can be severe. In pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2, the lung lining is known to alter the composition of the lung microbiome, in addition to lymphocyte damage that can promote the growth of bacteria to initiate bacterial pneumonia, and it is estimated that the prevalence of coinfection / superinfection reaches 50% among deaths from COVID-19.

6346,"Completed","Treatment of bone and joint infections remains difficult and variable according to centres and countries. Clindamycin given intravenously and followed by an oral route is recommended for the treatment of staphylococcal, streptococcal and anaerobes bone and joint infections by the French Society for Infectious Diseases. For staphylococcal bone and implant infections, rifampin is a major drug, as it remains active in bacterial biofilm and on quiescent staphylococci. For that reasons, clindamycin-rifampin combination therapy is frequently used in these infections.Clindamycin is metabolized by the P450 3A4 cytochrome, an enzyme strongly inducible by rifampin. A retrospective study published in 2010 on 70 patients treated for bone and joint infections showed that clindamycin serum concentrations were significantly lower when clindamycin was combined with rifampin (5.3 mg/liter vs 8.9 mg/liter; p<0.02). This drug interaction could even be stronger with the oral route, because of hepatic first-past effect, ending up with very low clindamycin serum concentration, a risk of selecting resistant microorganisms and treatment failure. This latter point is an important issue, because clindamycin has an excellent oral bioavailability and is frequently used in oral regimens. In the above study, a wide variability of clindamycin serum concentration was observed in the group of patients treated with combination therapy (1-12mg/l) suggesting interindividual variability. Rifampin induction of CYP 450 3A4/A5 depends on different receptor (PXR, RXR, LXRalpha) submitted to genetic polymorphism. Hypothesis: Plasma clearance of clindamycin (CLclin) combined with rifampicin (CLclinrif) is higher when clindamycin is administered by the oral route (CLclinrif OR) compared with IV administration (CLclinrif IV).","Arthritis, Infectious|Bone Diseases, Infectious","No","Observational","December 2015","December 2019","usual antibiotic treatment","Drug",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"France",,"49",,

Up to six months of treatment with FLZ is recommended for RVVC. Over the last ten years, the use of FLZ has increased markedly in many countries. No major problems have been noted with resistance development, but there is concern that this will occur in the future and alternative treatments are requested. In recent years, it has emerged that flukonazol interacts with several different types of drugs that are common in the patient group; several antidepressants, pain relief at dysmenorrhea (NSAID) and oral contraceptives to name a few.||In Sweden an over-the-counter vaginal cream consisting of 1% chlorhexidine gluconate (Hibitane®) is available with the indication antiseptic use in vaginal examinations, especially during childbirth. The product has been used for a long time in various gynecological and obstetric surgical procedures. Hibitane® is approved during pregnancy and the cream is usually well tolerated.||Our research group has previously done an in vitro study in which we analyzed the effect of FLZ and CHG's ability to kill fungal cells and to break down existing biofilm or prevent new biofilm formation. The biofilm formation is an important stage for the fungal cells to attach to surfaces such as skin and mucosa and is considered a first step in the development of an infection. In the biofilm, the fungus can hide from the immune system and also to some extent for various treatments aimed against the fungus. The results of the study showed that CHG was better than FLZ both at killing the fungal cells and preventing new biofilm from forming and dissolving already established ""old"" biofilm.

Although the risk of full blown infection with CFNB has been poorly defined, the rate of catheter colonization after antisepsis with povidone-iodine has been demonstrated to be high (Cuivillion et al. showed the rate of colonization to be 57% after 48 hours). Recently, several anecdotal case reports have demonstrated severe infectious complications including psoas abscess and necrotizing fasciitis associated with continuous nerve block techniques. As the use of CFNB techniques increase in popularity, infectious complications will undoubtedly become more common.||The American Society of Regional Anesthesia and Pain Medicine recommends the routine use of antiseptic solutions with an alcohol base for skin disinfection before peripheral regional techniques due to their penetration of the stratum corneum and their rapid and prolonged effect. Chlorhexidine(chloraprep) has been proven to be better than povidone iodine solution for skin preparation before epidural catheter and intravascular device insertion (Kinirons et al., Ostrander et al., Mimoz et al.,). The goal of this prospective trial therefore is to determine if an alcoholic solution of 0.5% chlorhexidine is more effective than an aqueous solution of 10% povidone-iodine in reducing catheter colonization and reducing skin flora associated with short term ( 48 hours) postoperative continuous femoral nerve catheter placement.

Although the clinical response to amphotericin B treatment in the AIDS patients is generally good, administration difficulties and toxicity detract from its usefulness. Oral treatment with ketoconazole overcomes these limitations of amphotericin B, but does not appear to be effective for primary treatment in patients with AIDS. Itraconazole is a triazole compound in which preclinical studies have demonstrated activity against Histoplasmosis capsulatum. Preclinical studies have also shown that itraconazole appears effective in the treatment of histoplasmosis. The frequency of adverse reactions to itraconazole has been low in several studies. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement occurs in up to 20 percent of patients with histoplasmosis, and appears to have a poor response to amphotericin B treatment. Itraconazole has been used successfully in a small number of patients with cryptococcal meningitis, supporting a study of its use in CNS histoplasmosis.","HIV Infections|Histoplasmosis","No","Interventional",,"September 1994","Itraconazole","Drug","Phase 2","All",,"13 Years","Treatment",,"United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States",,"30",,

Albicans is considered one of the most common infections of the lower female genital tract affecting 75% of women at least once in their lifetime. Recurrent VVC (RVVC) is arbitrarily defined as four or more episodes every year. RVVC is a debilitating, long-term condition that can severely affect the quality of life of women. Several factors have been associated with RVVC such as prolonged use of antibiotics, inadequately treated infection, uncontrolled diabetes, immune mechanisms (e.g. HIV), oral contraceptive use as well as the resistance of non-albicans Candida species (e.g. C glabrata, C krusei) to conventional antifungal agents as azoles.||Fluconazole administered orally is the most commonly used antifungal drug in the case of RVVC. However, in the last decade, fluconazole-resistant C Albicans has been reported in women with RVVC. Terconazole is a broad-spectrum, triazole antifungal treatment agent for both C Albicans and non-albicans. Its use (80 mg vaginal suppository daily for 6 days) was as effective as two doses of oral fluconazole (150 mg) in the treatment of patients with severe VVC and RVVC.||Boric acid or boracic [B(OH)3] is a weak acid with proven antifungal action.

6486,"Completed","Background Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with hemato-oncological malignancies. Due to the crude mortality of >90% in absence of adequate treatment, timely diagnosis and early start of antifungal therapy are key factors in the successful treatment of IPA. Various studies have shown that early initiation of antifungal therapy may improve IPA survival to above 70%. Diagnosis of IPA, however, remains difficult as clinical signs and symptoms as well as radiological findings are often unspecific and conventional culture methods lack sensitivity. In recent years antigen testing has therefore become one of the cornerstones of IPA diagnostics. Brochoalveolar lavage (BAL) Galactomannan (GM) testing is currently the most promising approach for early detection of pulmonary infections by this fungus. However, limitations of GM detection are assay turn-around time, which varies widely between centers (less than a day to several days), and the need for appropriately equipped laboratories that routinely test for this antigen. These limitations are overcome by the Aspergillus Lateral-Flow Device (LFD), a novel point-of-care (POC) test for IPA diagnosis developed by Dr Thornton at the University of Exeter, UK. This simple, rapid (15 min), single-use test can be performed in rudimentary facilities using BAL specimens. In a retrospective single centre study we have recently evaluated the LFD test in 39 BAL samples from hematologic malignancy patients and solid organ transplant recipients. Sensitivities and specificities of BAL LFD tests for probable IPA were 100% and 81%, respectively. Galactomannan levels in cases with negative LFD were significantly lower than in patients with positive LFD (P <0.0001). We concluded that the LFD test of BAL specimens is performed easily and provides accurate and rapidly available results. Therefore, this new point-of-care test may be a very promising diagnostic approach for detecting IPA in BAL specimens from haematological malignancy and SOT patients. For routine clinical use, however, multicenter studies with larger sample sizes also from other patient collectives are necessary. In this multicenter study we will evaluate the LFD test in BAL samples.||Study Objectives Primary Objectives To evaluate the Lateral Flow Device test, a rapid (15 min), point-of-care test for IPA diagnosis using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluids from patients at risk for IPA.||Secondary Objective To evaluate the potential of BAL Lateral Flow Device test for prognosis in patients with IPA.||Study Design This is a prospective multi-center study conducted in three centers in Austria (Graz, Vienna and Innsbruck) and one centre in Germany (Mannheim). In order to meet the objectives an estimated number of 300 BAL samples from patients at risk for IPA (50 to 100 per centre) will be included in the study cohort. The Lateral Flow Device test will be performed prospectively in BAL samples from the patients and results will be compared to GM results, PCR findings, clinical/radiological findings as well as conventional culture results. In addition, retrospective testing of BAL samples that were previously routinely tested for GM will be performed in up to three participating centers (Graz, Innsbruck and Mannheim) to ensure to reach the proposed number of 300 BAL samples. The treating clinicians will not be informed about BAL Lateral Flow Device test results and the test will therefore have no impact on patient management / treatment decisions.","Invasive Pulmonary Aspergillosis","No","Observational","February 2013","February 2019","Lateral Flow Device Test","Device",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Austria|Austria|Austria|Germany",,"350",,

6492,"Unknown status","In the context of Candida yeast infections, a large number of studies have been published over the past two decades specifying the molecular mechanisms of antifungal resistance in different Candida species. However, few of these studies have explored how these mechanisms influence host immune response to this opportunistic pathogen. Recent advances in understanding how the host's immune system responds to Candida have initiated the emergence of a new research theme aimed at better understanding Candida's intrinsic and adaptive resistance mechanisms to antifungals can modulate ""escape to"" or ""recognition by"" the host's immune system. This knowledge could lead to (i) a better understanding of the predominance of certain Candida species with antifungal resistance in certain patient populations, (ii) a better understanding of why high levels of in vitro resistance are not necessarily correlated with in vivo therapeutic failure, and (iii) effective immunotherapeutic strategies to control Candida resistance to antifungals.||It is therefore crucial to investigate the impact of Candida's resistance to antifungals on the host's innate immune response. Indeed, most antifungal resistance mechanisms have a direct or indirect structural modification of the fungal wall. However, it is the composition of this wall that is involved in the recognition of Candida by the host cell via the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). We therefore put forward the very probable hypothesis that changes in the fungal wall, induced by the appearance of resistance, could alter the recognition of Candida by PRRs and thus trigger a different immune response, either qualitatively (type of cytokines secreted) or quantitatively (amplitude and duration of the immune response). However, even if initial experimental data support the hypothesis of a possible link between resistance and a modulation of the innate immune response in digestive mucosa (the most frequent starting point for disseminated candidiasis), many questions remain regarding (i) the proteins and mechanisms of the modulated immune cascade, (ii) the modification of the immune response according to the Candida species in question and (iii) the modification of the immune response according to the resistance phenotype in question.","Candidemia of C.

Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs) are one of the most common infections presented in primary care and empirical antimicrobial treatment is currently recommended. Previous research has identified that a substantial proportion of Irish GPs prescribe antimicrobials for UTI that are not in accordance with the Guidelines for Antimicrobial Prescribing in Primary Care in Ireland.||Aim To design, implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a complex intervention on GP antimicrobial prescribing and adult (18 years of age and over) patients' antimicrobial consumption when presenting with a suspected UTI.||Methods The SIMPLE study is a randomised three armed intervention with practice level randomisation. Adult patients presenting with suspected UTI in primary care will be included in the study.||The intervention integrates components for both GPs and patients. For GPs the intervention includes interactive workshops, audit and feedback reports and automated electronic prompts summarising recommended first line antimicrobial treatment and, for one intervention arm, a recommendation to consider delayed antimicrobial prescribing. For patients multimedia applications and information leaflets are included. A minimum of 920 patients will be recruited through 30 practices. The primary outcome is change in prescribing of first line antimicrobials in accordance with the Guidelines for Antimicrobial Prescribing in Primary Care in Ireland. The intervention will take place over 15 months. Data will be collected through a remote electronic anonymised data extraction system (iPCRN), a text messaging system and through GP and patient interviews and surveys. The intervention will be strengthened by the implementation of a social marketing framework and an economic evaluation.","Uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","September 2013","September 2014","Improving GP antibiotics prescribing behaviour","Behavioral","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","Ireland","Randomized","2577",,

Giving chemotherapy and low-dose TBI before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells. It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Also, monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can find cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine (CSP) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) after transplant may stop this from happening.","Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23 (MLL) Abnormalities|Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Del(5q)|Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Inv(16)(p13;q22)|Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(15;17)(q22;q12)|Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(16;16)(p13;q22)|Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(8;21)(q22;q22)|Adult Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma|Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Angioimmunoblastic T-cell Lymphoma|Childhood Burkitt Lymphoma|Childhood Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia|Childhood Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma|Childhood Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Childhood Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma|Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia|Contiguous Stage II Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma|Contiguous Stage II Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma|Contiguous Stage II Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma|Contiguous Stage II Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Contiguous Stage II Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue|Hepatosplenic T-cell Lymphoma|Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Unclassifiable|Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma|Noncontiguous Stage II Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma|Noncontiguous Stage II Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma|Noncontiguous Stage II Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma|Noncontiguous Stage II Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Noncontiguous Stage II Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Peripheral T-cell Lymphoma|Previously Treated Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Progressive Hairy Cell Leukemia, Initial Treatment|Recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis|Recurrent Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult T-cell Leukemia/Lymphoma|Recurrent Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Recurrent Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Recurrent Childhood Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Childhood Large Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Childhood Lymphoblastic Lymphoma|Recurrent Childhood Small Noncleaved Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma|Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma|Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma|Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome|Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Recurrent/Refractory Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma|Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Refractory Hairy Cell Leukemia|Refractory Multiple Myeloma|Relapsing Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia|Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Stage I Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma|Stage I Childhood Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Stage I Childhood Large Cell Lymphoma|Stage I Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Stage I Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage I Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage I Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Stage I Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Stage I Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome|Stage I Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Stage II Childhood Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Stage II Childhood Large Cell Lymphoma|Stage II Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Stage II Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome|Stage III Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma|Stage III Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma|Stage III Childhood Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Stage III Childhood Large Cell Lymphoma|Stage III Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Stage III Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage III Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage III Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Stage III Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Stage III Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome|Stage III Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Stage IV Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma|Stage IV Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma|Stage IV Childhood Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Stage IV Childhood Large Cell Lymphoma|Stage IV Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Stage IV Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage IV Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma|Stage IV Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Stage IV Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Stage IV Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome|Stage IV Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|T-cell Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia|Waldenström Macroglobulinemia","No","Interventional","November 2001","December 2009","alemtuzumab|fludarabine phosphate|total-body irradiation|allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation|peripheral blood stem cell transplantation|mycophenolate mofetil|cyclosporine","Biological|Drug|Radiation|Procedure|Procedure|Drug|Drug","Phase 2","All","74 Years",,"Treatment","Single Group Assignment","United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|Italy","N/A","60",,"24|0|0|0|0|0"

Ths specific objectives are to determine the overall incidence of invasive fungal infections, use of antifungal agents, duration of hospitalization and mortality in this cohort, and to evaluate if this strategy is associated with a reduction in the expected use of antifungal agents if a classical empiric antifungal strategy was used, without an increase in the incidence of invasive fungal infections.||This is a prospective, non randomized, non comparative study. Patients aged ≥ 18 years are eligible if they have acute leukemia, myelodysplasia or other baseline disease submitted to chemotherapy or to allogeneic stem cell transplantation with an expected duration of neutropenia (neutrophil count <500cells/mm³) of at least 10 days. Exclusion criteria are patients with and a past history of or invasive mold infection and those who do not want to participate. The study has no comparator arm. However, the investigators intend to determine if the algorithm based on the D-index would result in a 50% reduction in the use of antifungal agents, if all patients with persistent fever and neutropenia received empiric antifungal therapy. Based on our database of ~2,000 episodes of febrile neutropenia, 36% of patients had persistent fever between days 4 and 7 of antibiotics and would receive empiric antifungal therapy.

Crypto causes 15-20% of HIV/AIDS-related deaths worldwide. However, this infection can be detected before one develops symptoms and becomes ill. People can be screened for infection by a blood test to detect ""cryptococcal antigen,"" (called CrAg), which is part of the fungus, in blood. The World Health Organization and over 22 countries worldwide recommend CrAg screening of all persons with advanced AIDS entering or re-entering into HIV care.||However, it is not known how best to treat people with cryptococcal antigen in their blood, who don't otherwise yet have symptoms of infection around their brain. If no treatment is given, almost all people will develop infection of the brain and/or die. International guidelines suggest using both HIV medicines and an anti-fungal medicine, called fluconazole, to treat this early infection. However, despite this treatment approximately 1 in 4 people may get sick and/or die.||Researchers have recently discovered another medicine that may work against the Cryptococcus fungus. This medicine is called Sertraline, and it is actually a medicine that has been used for more than 25 years to treat depression (sadness). Sertraline is one of the most commonly used medicines worldwide.||The purpose of this research clinical trial is to determine if standard fluconazole antifungal therapy plus a high dose of Sertraline, will be better than standard fluconazole therapy alone for treating early disseminated cryptococcal infection in persons who are asymptomatic and do not yet have infection of the brain (i.e. meningitis).||This study seeks to test if Sertraline will improve survival through 6-months.

6585,"Recruiting","Background: Recurrent vulvovaginal candidiasis (RVVC) is a common obstinate vulvovaginal inflammation in gynecology. At present, the pathogenesis of RVVC is not clear. In recent years, it is emphasized that the changes of vaginal microecological environment play an important role in the occurrence and development of RVVC. The treatment of RVVC can be divided into intensive treatment and consolidation treatment. Currently, local antifungal treatment is the main treatment regimen. While it is difficult and had an insufficient effect on prevention from recurrence of clinical signs and the improvement of vaginal mycological status in long term. Besides, there is no mature consolidation treatment regimen at home and abroad. Through the current application of the fractional CO2 laser in the treatment of atrophic vaginitis, it is confirmed that local irradiation of the fractional CO2 laser on vulva and vagina can regenerate and repair mucosal tissue, enhance the function of vaginal epithelial cells, gradually restore the normal pH value of vagina, improve vaginal microecological environment, restore the proportion of vaginal flora and reduce the recurrence rate of RVVC. This trial aims to explore the efficacy of two consolidation therapy schemes: the fractional CO2 laser and traditional antifungal drugs.||Methods/Design: The ongoing study will include 200 RVVC patients who voluntarily joined the study and signed the informed consent form the Second Affiliated Hospital of WMU during December 2019 to March 2022. After patients were cured by transvaginal local drug intensive therapy, participants will be randomly divided into control group (n = 100) and experimental group (n = 100). The control group continue to receive a monthly course of vaginal local drug consolidation therapy for 6 months, while the experimental group will be given monthly local vaginal CO2 laser consolidation therapy for 3 months. The vaginal secretions samples of RVVC patients will be collected before intensive therapy, after intensive therapy and at the end of consolidation therapy, and the species abundance and structure of vaginal flora were detected and analyzed. In the same period, 5 healthy women of childbearing age were recruited as the normal control group and the volunteers do not take any treatment. The vaginal secretions samples of 5 volunteers will be collected when signing the informed consent to detect and analyze the species abundance and structure of vaginal flora.||The patients with RVVC will be followed up for 3, 6 and 12 months after the treatment and vaginal secretions samples will be collected for vaginal flora structure detection to compare the vaginal microecological environment. For recurrent patients, the investigators will carry out targeted treatment, and again collect vaginal secretions sample to detect and analyze the species abundance and structure of vaginal flora.||Objectives: The aim of this study is to compare the effects of fractional CO2 laser consolidation therapy and traditional antifungal consolidation therapy for RVVC, and assess the role of fractional CO2 laser in changes of vaginal microecological environment and recurrence rate of VVC after consolidation treatment.","Vulvovaginal Candidiasis, Genital|Laser Therapy","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","December 13, 2019","May 2022","the fractional CO2 laser|Clotrimazole","Radiation|Drug","Not Applicable","Female","60 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","China","Randomized","205",,

AMENDED: 08/01/90 As of August 31, 1989, 437 patients were enrolled into uncontrolled studies of trimetrexate for PCP:214 in TX 301/ACTG 0=039 (trimetrexate for patients intolerant of approved therapies) and 223 in NS 401 (trimetrexate for patients refractory to approved therapies). The analysis of overall response rate, stringently defined as having received at least 14 days of trimetrexate and being alive at follow-up 1 month after the completion of therapy, reveals 84/159 intolerant patients and 48/160 refractory patients had responded, for rates of 53 percent and 30 percent, respectively. These response rates include all individuals who received at least one dose of trimetrexate. Of the 111 patients who were ventilator-dependent at study entry, 18 completed a course of therapy and were alive a month later, for a response rate of 16 percent. All other ventilated patients died. The most common severe (grades 3 and 4) toxicities were: transaminase elevation (> 5 x normal) in 94 patients, anemia (< 7.9 g/dl) in 109, neutropenia (< 750 cells/mm3) in 58, fever (> 40 C) in 37, and thrombocytopenia (< 50000 platelets/mm3) in 27. Toxicity required discontinuation of therapy in approximately 5 percent of all patients.||Original design: The drugs usually used to treat PCP in AIDS patients, trimethoprim / sulfamethoxazole and pentamidine, have had to be discontinued in many patients because of severe side effects. Currently there are no proven alternatives to these drugs. TMTX was chosen for this trial because it was found to be very active against the PCP organism in laboratory tests. Also TMTX, in combination with LCV, had a high response rate and did not cause severe toxicity in a preliminary trial.","Pneumonia, Pneumocystis Carinii|HIV Infections","No","Interventional",,"July 2004","Trimetrexate glucuronate|Leucovorin calcium","Drug|Drug","Phase 3","All",,"12 Years","Treatment",,"United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States|United States",,,,

6614,"Completed","This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of a modified donor stem cell transplantation procedure for treating advanced mycosis fungoides (MF), a lymphoma primarily affecting the skin, and Sezary syndrome (SS), a leukemic form of the disease. Donated stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into the different blood components white cells, red cells and platelets) can cure patients with certain leukemias and lymphomas and multiple myeloma. These cells generate a completely new, functioning bone marrow. In addition, immune cells from the donor grow and generate a new immune system to help fight infections. The new immune cells also attack any residual tumor cells left in the body after intensive chemotherapy. However, stem cell transplantation carries a significant risk of death, because it requires completely suppressing the immune system with high-dose chemotherapy and radiation. In addition, lymphocytes from the donor may cause what is called graft vs. host disease (GvHD), in which these cells see the patient s cells as foreign and mount an immune response to destroy them. To try to reduce these risks, patients in this study will be given low-dose chemotherapy and no radiation, a regimen that is easier for the body to tolerate and involves a shorter period of complete immune suppression. In addition, a monoclonal antibody called Campath-1H will be given to target lymphocytes, including those that have become cancerous.||Patients with advanced MF or SS who are between 18 and 70 years of age and have a matched family donor 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history, physical examination and blood tests, lung and heart function tests, X-rays of the chest, eye examination, and bone marrow sampling (withdrawal through a needle of about a tablespoon of marrow from the hip bone), and small skin biopsy (surgical removal of a piece of tissue for microscopic examination) or needle biopsy of the tumor.||Stem cells will be collected from both the patient and donor. To do this, the hormone G-CSF will be injected under the skin for several days to push stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Then, the stem cells will be collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the required cells are separated out and removed. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.||Before the transplant, a central venous line (large plastic tube) is placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body and be used the entire treatment period to deliver the donated stem cells, give medications, transfuse blood, if needed, and withdraw blood samples. Several days before the transplant procedure, patients will start a conditioning regimen of low-dose chemotherapy with Campath 1H, fludarabine, and, if necessary, cyclophosphamide. When the conditioning therapy is completed, the stem cells will be infused over a period of up to 4 hours. To help prevent rejection of donor cells and GvHD, cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil will be given by mouth or by vein for about 3 months starting 4 days before the transplantation.||The anticipated hospital stay is 3 to 4 days, when the first 3 doses of Campath will be monitored for drug side effects. The rest of the procedures, including the transplant, can be done on an outpatient basis. Follow-up visits for the first 3 months after the transplant will be scheduled once or twice a week for a physical examination, blood tests and symptoms check. Then, visits will be scheduled at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 48 months post-transplant.

Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as fludarabine, and TBI before a donor bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cancer or abnormal cells and helps stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine (CSP) and mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) after the transplant may stop this from happening.","Accelerated Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia|Acute Undifferentiated Leukemia|Adult

6618,"Completed","HIV infection leads to destruction of CD4+T cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and promotes a decline in mechanical barrier functions of the gut mucosa, and the subsequent translocation of microbial products from the gastrointestinal tract to systemic circulation. The gut mucosal immune system is not completely restored by cART, and the resultant microbial translocation may contribute to chronic inflammation, inadequate CD4 T-cell recovery, and increased rates of serious non-AIDS events. Many studies have revealed strong and characteristic compositional differences in gut microbiota between individuals with HIV infection and seronegative controls. So far, several probiotic organisms have shown the ability to enhance intestinal epithelial barrier functions, reduce inflammation, and support effective Th-1 responses. Probiotics mainly stimulates polymeric IgA secretion, avoid bacterial overgrowth and their translocation, and produce a self-limited inflammatory response through development of regulatory T (Treg) cells by anti-inflammatory cytokine production. Therefore, we design a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine whether the use of a probiotic can expand beneficial microbiota that aid in decreasing bacterial translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokine production, thereby improving immune functions in HIV-infected subjects. Participants in the intervention group will receive oral probiotic containing 3 billion Bifidobacterium and 1 billion Lactobacillus once daily, while those in the placebo group will take placebo which contains no probiotic but has the same flavor and characteristics as the probiotic product..

The spontaneous attack rate of 16% within the first 6 months following allogeneic HSCT reported in the 1980's has considerably decreased with prophylaxis. However, PcP still remains a concern in the transplant ward with an incidence rate up to 2.5% in allo- and 1.4% in autologous HSCT but up to 7.2% on low dose of Dapsone. The mortality of PcP is especially high in HSCT recipients. One of the main factors of PcP after HSCT seems to be either the lack of TMP-SMX prophylaxis (all the other prophylactic drugs being inferior to TMP-SMX), or poor compliance to prophylaxis. Due to the rarity of the disease after HSCT, it is impossible to study it in monocenter studies, except on very long periods of time which may not reflect current practice. Several questions deserve investigations in a multicenter study, about timing, risk factors, and outcome.||Moreover, some European laboratories involved in the diagnosis of PcP have already given up to classical diagnostic methods and switched to qPCR.

6628,"Recruiting","Urinary tract infection (UTI) continues to be the leading cause of infection and hospitalization in post-kidney transplant (RT) surveillance. Facts such as immunosuppression, anatomical alterations and catheters are part of the factors that contribute to a high prevalence of this condition. The incidence during the first trimester is highly variable and ranges between 15 and 50 %. This variability often depends on the definition of UTI, which sometimes overlaps with asymptomatic bacteriuria (AB). Currently the indication for treatment of AB is clear in pregnant patients and urological procedures. In post-RT surveillance, the treatment of AB is controversial. The use of Trimetropim Sulfamethoxazole during the first 6 months post RT is currently a recommendation, however new evidence has found the absence of benefit in the treatment of AB. Given the high prevalence of post RT AB and the increase in bacterial resistance, determining the usefulness of searching for and treating post RT AB is a priority in this population. Methodology: Randomized Controlled trial of kidney transplant candidates which will be randomized in the following groups: Group 1 (intervention) where the urine cultures will be analyzed openly, and in the case of asymptomatic bacteriuria, treatment based on the germ and antibiogram will be prescribed. Group 2 will undergo urine cultures at the same post-transplant times, the results will not be known by the clinical team and the participants will not receive treatment in the presence of present AB. Both groups, in the presence of UTI symptoms, will undergo urine culture and receive empirical treatment, which will be adjusted based on an antibiogram. The primary objective is to assess the prevalence of UTI, pyelonephritis, UTI-related hospitalizations, and antimicrobial resistance. As a secondary objective, the germs and associated virulence genes will be analyzed. Surveillance will be carried out for two months after transplantation and the predefined times for the evaluation of the BA will be: after the removal of the urinary catheter, week 3 and after the removal of the ureteral stent (month 2).","Asymptomatic Bacteriuria|Kidney Transplant Infection","No","Interventional","January 1, 2020","June 1, 2022","Urinary culture and treatment if asymptomatic bacteriuria is detected","Diagnostic Test","Not Applicable","All",,,"Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Mexico","Randomized","124",,

In this case, the LBA is mostly non-contributory and the diagnosis is based solely on the detection of cysts on histological examination on biopsy of a pulmonary nodule.

6669,"Unknown status","Background: Onychomycosis, the most common nail disorder, is a superficial fungal infection affecting toenails more than fingernails. Onychomycosis can cause pain and discomfort and has the potential to be a source of morbidity. Although oral antifungal agents achieve a better complete cure rate for onychomycosis, many patients are worried about the side effects and unwilling to take oral medications. Phytonail is a mixture of herbal active ingredients including tea tree oil, lavender oil and Australian blue cypress oil with BioEqual carrier system. A preliminary trial has shown a 100% KOH negative rate in 32 nails after 12 weeks of Phytonail therapy. Amorolfine 5% nail lacquer (Loceryl) is a broad-spectrum morpholine antifungal demonstrated 60-75% mycological cure rate in several randomized controlled trials for the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.||Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of Phytonail relative to amorolfine 5% nail lacquer in the treatment of toenail onychomycosis.||Methods: This is a randomized, parallel-group, open-labeled study in adult subjects with toenail onychomycosis. In this study, 60 eligible patients will be randomized in a 1: 1 ratio to one of the two treatment groups: Phytonail or amorolfine 5% nail lacquer. Before randomization, patients are to have onychomycosis in at least one great toenail with positive KOH examination and positive fungal culture. During the treatment phase, Phytonail will be applied twice daily and amorolfine 5% nail lacquer once weekly for 16 weeks to all affected toenails. Physician's assessments and photographic analyses will be carried out at baseline, Week 4, 8, 16, and 24. Mycological evaluation including KOH examination will be performed at baseline, Week 4, 8, and 16. Fungal culture will be performed at baseline and for KOH negative patients.","Onycomycosis","No","Interventional","February 2013","July 2014","Phytonail|Loceryl","Drug|Drug","Not Applicable","All","65 Years","20 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Taiwan","Randomized","72",,

6671,"Recruiting","Among Enterobacteriaceae, the production of beta-lactamases (ESBLs) is the leading cause of multi-resistance. The first cases of ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (E-ESBL) infections were described in the 1980s and subsequently experienced worldwide dissemination.||Since the turn of the century, the prevalence of E-ESBL infections, especially among Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) has increased dramatically.||The emergence of multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is currently a real public health problem. The European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Network evaluated, among clinical strains, the rate of resistance to 3rd generation cephalosporins (C3G) at 9.5% for E. coli and 28% for K. pneumoniae. Numerous studies have shown that bacterial colonization is the prerequisite for the occurrence of many infections.||However, the existence of prior colonization does not seem to be the only risk factor for the occurrence of a secondary infection. Therefore, in patients with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacillus gastrointestinal carriage there appear to be factors associated with the onset of infection. Several studies have examined the risk factors associated with E-ESBL-related infections in both community-based and healthcare-associated / nosocomial infections. Two main risk factors seem to be associated with E-ESBL infections: prior antibiotic therapy and the existence of invasive devices.||A recent study, carried out on 1288 patients and aimed at validating a predictive score for the occurrence of ESBL-E bacteremia, demonstrated 5 factors associated with the appearance of E-ESBL-linked bacteremia. These factors were: (i) a history of colonization / infection with ESBL-E, (ii) age ≥ 43 years, (iii) recent hospitalization in a region with a high prevalence of ESBL-E, (iv) antibiotic therapy ≥ 6 days in the previous 6 months and (v) the existence of a chronic vascular access.||Recently, a retrospective case-control study conducted in the United States by Augustine et al. Suggested that 5% of cases of bacteremia were related to ESBL-E.||Few studies have looked at risk factors for infection in patients known to be colonized by the digestive system. In a retrospective case-control study, conducted outside the intensive care unit and including pediatric and adult patients, the authors identified 2 factors associated with the occurrence of Ec-ESBL infection in previously colonized patients. These two factors were the prior use of antibiotics with β-lactam antibiotics and β-lactamase inhibitor (s), and urinary catheterization.||In intensive care hospital patients, the occurrence of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae infection appears to be a rare event, including in colonized patients.||The work of Ruppé et al. showed a direct link between relative fecal abundance of EScher-producing Escherichia coli and prior antibiotic intake.||This work also demonstrated a link between the value of the relative fecal abundance in Ec-ESBL and the occurrence of a urinary tract infection linked to the same clone. In particular, the authors found that women with a low relative fecal abundance rate (≤ 0.1%) had no risk of developing an Escherichia coli urinary tract infection. Conversely, the risk increased with the relative fecal abundance of Escherichia coli, but with a positive predictive value limited to 57% for relative fecal abundances between 10 and 100%.","Enterobacteria Infections","No","Interventional","March 17, 2021","December 31, 2023","Control (Patients colonized rectally with ESBL-producing enterobacteria without antibiotic pressure)|Case (Patients colonized rectally with ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae, with antibiotic pressure)","Other|Other","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Diagnostic","Parallel Assignment","France|France|France|France","Non-Randomized","200",,

Among individuals diagnosed with primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis, we aim to describe the clinical course, predictors of the clinical course and compare the response to prescribed antifungal therapy versus no antifungal therapy.

Step 1 will identify which subjects have primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis based on the case definition for the protocol and Step 2 will follow subjects who meet the case definition and will observe their clinical management and clinical outcomes. Subjects will enroll in Step 1 within 28 days of symptom onset. In Step 1, blood work for serologic determination of Coccidioides infection will be drawn at the time of enrollment (Day 1), and again 21 days later if a positive result is not reported at Day 1. Subjects with a diagnosis of primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis confirmed by positive serologic testing during Step 1 will enter Step 2 within 21 days of a positive test result; subjects with a negative serology at Day 1 and Day 22 will not be followed further.

6776,"Completed","A. Statement of Hypotheses:||HIV-infected patients have an increased incidence of emphysema compared to non-HIV-infected smokers, and it has been hypothesized that this accelerated disease progression is the result of one or more latent infections that amplifies the pulmonary inflammatory response to cigarette smoke. Pneumocystis is one infectious agent that likely plays a key role in the development of HIV-associated emphysema. Colonization with Pneumocystis has been demonstrated in HIV-infected subjects, and HIV-infected smokers are particularly susceptible to Pc colonization regardless of CD4 cell count or use of prophylaxis. Pneumocystis colonization is also increased in non-HIV-infected patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and is directly related to the severity of the disease. The presence of Pneumocystis in the lungs, even at low levels as seen in colonization, produces inflammatory changes similar to those seen in COPD, with increases in the numbers of neutrophils and cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes. We propose that Pneumocystis accelerates emphysema in HIV-infected smokers by stimulating inflammation and tissue destruction. We will examine the role of co-infection with Pneumocystis in the pathogenesis of HIV-associated emphysema and the mechanism by which it causes emphysema progression. These studies will lead to information that will provide a rational basis for prevention and therapy of HIV-associated emphysema and provide a model for emphysema in the general population","HIV Infections|Pneumocystis Pneumonia|Emphysema|Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease|Asthma","No","Observational","August 2007","July 2013",,,,"All",,"18 Years",,,"United States",,"250",,

Risk-factors for invasive candidiasis include improvements in intensive care strategies (i.e., central venous catheters, mechanical ventilation, hyper-alimentation), prolonged stays in intensive care units (ICUs), the development of more aggressive surgical techniques, and the prolongation of survival of critically-ill patients. Two other important factors, observed mainly in cancer patients, are colonization of mucous membranes by yeasts, and neutropenia, resulting from increased use of antibiotics and anti-neoplastic agents, respectively. The crude mortality rate of candidaemia is high (38-75%), and the attributable mortality has been estimated at 25-38%. During the past 15 years, the prevalence of infections caused by non-albicans Candida spp. has increased exponentially, so that these organisms now account for > 50% of episodes of fungaemia in various surveys. The increase in invasive fungal infections, the associated high mortality rate, and the emergence of antifungal resistance, have all driven the search for more potent antifungal drugs.

Score system have been developed to identify groups at very high risk for the development of candidemia/invasive candidiasis in the ICU. These scoring system have used clinical information with or without data on Candida colonization, and have shown reasonable correlation with candidemia/invasive candidiasis. More recently, a biomarker - detection of 1,3-beta-D-glucan in the serum - has been tested in the early diagnosis of candidiasis. The incorporation of biomarkers such as beta-D-glucan could help clinicians to select a group at higher risk for candidemia, and despite the fact that these tests may give false-positive results, their negative predictive value could be of great help.||Therefore, the objectives of this study are:||To assess the frequency of positive biomarkers in ICU patients at high risk to develop invasive candidiasis/candidemia;|To test the strategy of early discontinuation of antifungal therapy based on repeatedly negative blood cultures and 1,3 beta-D-glucan in the serum.","Candidemia","No","Interventional","November 2012","December 2013","Anidulafungin","Drug","Phase 4","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","Brazil","N/A","85",,"0"

When the stem cells from an unrelated donor, that do not exactly match the patient's blood, are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can make an immune response against the body's normal cells. Giving antithymocyte globulin before transplant and cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil after transplant may stop this from happening.||PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well donor umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant works in treating patients with hematologic malignancies.","Acute Myeloid Leukemia With Multilineage Dysplasia Following Myelodysplastic Syndrome|Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Remission|Adult Acute Megakaryoblastic Leukemia (M7)|Adult Acute Minimally Differentiated Myeloid Leukemia (M0)|Adult Acute Monoblastic Leukemia (M5a)|Adult Acute Monocytic Leukemia (M5b)|Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission|Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With 11q23 (MLL) Abnormalities|Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia With t(16;16)(p13;q22)|Adult Erythroleukemia (M6a)|Adult Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma|Adult Pure Erythroid Leukemia (M6b)|B-cell Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|B-cell Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Blastic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia|Burkitt Lymphoma|Childhood Acute Erythroleukemia (M6)|Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in Remission|Childhood Acute Megakaryocytic Leukemia (M7)|Childhood Acute Minimally Differentiated Myeloid Leukemia (M0)|Childhood Acute Monoblastic Leukemia (M5a)|Childhood Acute Monocytic Leukemia (M5b)|Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission|Childhood Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia|Childhood Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma|Childhood Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Childhood Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Childhood Nasal Type Extranodal NK/T-cell Lymphoma|Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia|Chronic Phase Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia|Cutaneous B-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|de Novo Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Extranodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma of Mucosa-associated Lymphoid Tissue|Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia|Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasm, Unclassifiable|Nodal Marginal Zone B-cell Lymphoma|Previously Treated Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Prolymphocytic Leukemia|Recurrent Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Recurrent Adult Burkitt Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Diffuse Large Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Diffuse Mixed Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Diffuse Small Cleaved Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis|Recurrent Adult Immunoblastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Adult Lymphoblastic Lymphoma|Recurrent Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|Recurrent Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Recurrent Childhood Anaplastic Large Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Childhood Grade III Lymphomatoid Granulomatosis|Recurrent Childhood Large Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Childhood Lymphoblastic Lymphoma|Recurrent Childhood Small Noncleaved Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Cutaneous T-cell Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma|Recurrent Grade 1 Follicular Lymphoma|Recurrent Grade 2 Follicular Lymphoma|Recurrent Grade 3 Follicular Lymphoma|Recurrent Mantle Cell Lymphoma|Recurrent Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Recurrent Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome|Recurrent Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma|Refractory Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Relapsing Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia|Secondary Acute Myeloid Leukemia|Secondary Myelodysplastic Syndromes|Secondary Myelofibrosis|Splenic Marginal Zone Lymphoma|Stage I Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Stage II Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Stage III Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|Stage IV Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia|T-cell Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|T-cell Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia|T-cell Large Granular Lymphocyte Leukemia|Waldenstrom Macroglobulinemia","No","Interventional","September 2007","December 2015","double-unit umbilical cord blood transplantation|cytogenetic analysis|bone marrow aspiration|fluorescence in situ hybridization|busulfan|cyclophosphamide|anti-thymocyte globulin|methylprednisolone|cyclosporine|mycophenolate mofetil|flow cytometry|allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation","Procedure|Other|Procedure|Other|Drug|Drug|Drug|Drug|Drug|Drug|Other|Procedure","Phase 2","All","64 Years","12 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","United States","N/A","14","11","9"

Morbidity due to IPs is greatest in school-age children who typically have the highest burden of infection. In 2001, WHO passed a resolution for the use of large-scale mass drug administration (MDA) of antihelminthic drugs to deworm children in developing countries. Though initially effective, there is concern that MDA might not be sustainable over extended periods especially considering the large children populations and the high frequency of dosing. Further, the MDAs exert increasing drug pressure on parasite populations, a circumstance that is likely to favor parasite genotypes that can resist anthelmintic drugs. There is hence a need for alternatives that are not only affordable and sustainable but easier to implement in the long term with a minimal chance of development of resistance. The investigators propose to develop and test the feasibility of a corn porridge meal fortified with papaya fruit extracts that have been shown to have antihelminthic properties. The investigators intend to evaluate its efficacy when given through school feeding programs and compare the outcome with albendazole- the recommended MDA agent for deworming school children.

It is the most common opportunistic infections classifying patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (human immunodeficiency virus +) at the stage acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Data from the french Institute for Health Watch showed in 2011 that 31% of 1400 cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome were revealed by Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia.||Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia also increasingly concerns immunocompromised human immunodeficiency virus negative patients, due to the increasing use of immunosuppressive therapies (including corticosteroids), of anticancer cytostatics and biotherapies, in the context of grafts, transplants, but also from autoimmune or inflammatory chronic diseases.||Recent data show that the number of cases occurring in patients Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia human immunodeficiency virus - in France is now higher than the cases occurring in Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia +. The severity of the Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is increased in patients with human immunodeficiency virus -, in whom the evolution is faster, with mechanical ventilation often required and higher mortality, requiring a fast and early diagnosis. Routine diagnosis relies on the detection of the fungus in the bronchoalveolar lavage, using stains (May Grunwald Giemsa or immunofluorescence) and Polymerase Chain Reaction. Polymerase Chain Reaction provides a diagnostic gain in immunocompromised patients not infected with human immunodeficiency virus that may present a pejorative table quickly despite low fungal burden. However, the deoxyribonucleic acid of the fungus can sometimes be detected in the absence of scalable Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia, and then shows a pulmonary colonization by Pneumocystis jirovecii. It is therefore important to improve the positive predictive value of Pneumocystis Polymerase Chain Reaction, to guide the management of optimal patient.||In this work, the investigators propose to evaluate the Polymerase Chain Reaction on oropharyngeal rinse, non-invasive sampling and therefore probably less often positive and specific active infection.

In mycosis fungoides, the disease is generally limited to the skin, and people develop flat or raised areas on their skin where the lymphocytes have accumulated. Sometimes even larger aggregations of lymphocytes occur in the skin or lymph nodes, resulting in tumors. In Sézary syndrome, the skin is often reddened or itchy, and some abnormal lymphocytes circulate in the blood.||* Lymphocytes are a type of immune cells that is made in the bone marrow and is found in the blood. Lymphocytes have a number of roles in the immune system, including the production of antibodies and other substances that fight infections and other diseases.||In standard practice, the disease will be treated with conventional chemotherapy that unfortunately has a limited lasting benefit. In this study, we want to see if a new treatment option can optimize and improve response and make benefit last as long as possible. This new treatment option is immunotherapy, using atezolizumab (Tecentriq).||Immunotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal cells that may help cancer cell grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Atezolizumab blocks a protein called PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) from binding to its receptor found on the surface of lymphocytes. It helps to restore the immune activity of the body against the cancer.||Atezolizumab is already used to treat adults with a cancer that affects the bladder and the urinary system, called urothelial carcinoma, and a cancer that affects the lungs, called non-small cell lung cancer.||In this trial, patients will receive atezolizumab for one year unless the tumor starts growing again or this is not considered suitable for them anymore or they wish to stop the treatment.","Lymphoma, T-Cell, Cutaneous|Mycosis Fungoides/Sezary Syndrome","No","Interventional","September 24, 2018","June 2025","Atezolizumab","Drug","Phase 2","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","Spain|Switzerland","N/A","29",,

6937,"Completed","Suriname is a small developing country in South America with a population of half a million people. Early neonatal death in Suriname is high with 16 per 1000 live births. Unpublished data from the Suriname Perinatal and Infant Mortality Survey estimate contribution of infection to early neonatal mortality at 25% (4 per 1000 live births) of all deaths. In comparison, incidence rates of neonatal sepsis alone are 3.5 per 1000 live births. These numbers indicate an increased burden of neonatal infection in Suriname versus the U.S. In any case about 40 newborns that die each year of infection are a huge loss, also considering the small Surinamese community. Despite this overall idea on the impact of infectious disease in Surinamese neonates exact information regarding incidence, type of infection (e.g., localized, viral, early-onset or late-onset sepsis), risk factors (e.g., insufficient antenatal care, maternal Group B-Streptococcus status), etiology, microbial causes, morbidity, antibiotic treatment (type and duration), and epidemiological determinants (e.g., gestational age, sex, ethnicity) are lacking.||From a clinical perspective, there is still a challenge to identify neonates with infection. Neonates are often admitted with ambivalent clinical symptoms and receive preventive antibiotics that are costly, promote pathogen-resistance, and have negative long-term effects (i.e., on the development of the intestinal bacterial flora). Currently, assessment of blood leukocyte or trombocyte counts and levels of CRP are insufficiently sensitive to be used as biomarkers, while confirmation of actual sepsis or meningitis by positive culture results is relatively rare (0.5-3% in the United States). This complicates decisions on duration of antibiotic treatment and hospitalization significantly, while no other biomarkers exist.||The circulating isoforms of adhesion molecules (cAMs), which mediate interactions of leukocytes with the vascular endothelium, have been proposed as biomarkers for infection and sepsis. During infection they accumulate in the bloodstream as a result of shedding, which represents their removal from cell surfaces of endothelial cells and leukocytes by enzymes called sheddases. Recently, we have reviewed mechanisms behind shedding of cAMs in neonatal, pediatric and adult sepsis. The shedding process reflects a critical and active process in orchestrating interaction between leukocytes and the endothelium for an effective host response, while minimizing collateral tissue damage. As a result, both plasma levels of cAMs and their sheddases are subject to change during infection and sepsis. Additionally, compelling, albeit limited, data suggest changes of levels of cAMs in CSF in adult and pediatric meningitis.||To date, some evidence exists of changes in levels of cAMs during malaria (in children from Malawi) and sepsis, although not sensitive enough to predict outcomes in the clinic. Those levels have never been assessed simultaneously with levels of their sheddases in blood or CSF as a diagnostic tool. We propose that this combined approach may provide more detailed information about the extent of inflammatory activation in neonates.While a balance in levels is maintained under resting conditions or mild (local) infection, it may be perturbed during sepsis or meningitis . Thus, simultaneous measurement of these levels could promote early identification of infection, and may even distinguish between mild infection, systemic infection or meningitis. Currently, manufacturers are rapidly developing Luminex® technology as an advanced, fast, high-throughput and clinically feasible bedside tool for such an approach.||We hypothesize that incidence rates of neonates with infection in Suriname are high. We further hypothesize that, upon signs of infection, the simultaneous measurement of cAMs and their SEs in serum and CSF discriminates between infected and non-infected neonates. We aim to: 1) identify and follow neonates at the Academic Hospital Paramaribo with signs of infection to establish incidence rates of infection, and 2) investigate diagnostic potential of our proposed biomarker combination in these neonates for infection, type of infection (e.g., local (mild), sepsis or meningitis) and outcomes.","Neonatal Sepsis|Neonatal Infection|Neonatal Meningitis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","May 2015","August 2016",,,,"All","1 Month",,,,"Suriname",,"190",,

Giving chemotherapy and total-body irradiation before transplantation helps stop the growth of cancer cells and prevents the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. Healthy stem cells from a donor that are infused into the patient help the patient's bone marrow make blood cells; red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. Sometimes, however, the transplanted donor cells can cause an immune response against the body's normal cells, which is called graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).

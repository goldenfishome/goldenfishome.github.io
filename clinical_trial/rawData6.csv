HIV infection rates of up to 50% have been reported among patients diagnosed with syphilis in several regions, with higher HIV infection rates among MSM. Besides, syphilis ulcers are proposed to enhance the transmission of HIV. In Taiwan, there is also an increasing prevalence of syphilis and HIV co-infection among MSM. Therefore, to treat syphilis is an important issue for public health.||According to literature review, whether patients with HIV and syphilis co-infection had higher serologic failure rate remains controversial, especially in the era after highly active anti-retroviral therapy (HAART) was introduced since 1996. Ghanem et al recently demonstrated that the use of HAART may reduce syphilis failure rates among HIV-infected patients who have syphilis. In addition, the treatment guideline in 2006 suggested that the treatment of primary syphilis and secondary syphilis is single dose benzathine penicillin G regardless of HIV status; however, it goes on to suggest that ""some specialists recommended additional treatments for HIV-infected patients"", namely 3 doses, each a week apart. There is no reference and evidence of strength of the suggestion but only specialists' opinion.||In the study, we aim to compare serologic response of syphilis to penicillin treatment between HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected patients and to compare serologic response of early syphilis (primary or secondary) to 1 dose and 3 doses of benzathine penicillin G among HIV-infected patients.

5009,"Completed","Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis remains at epidemic levels globally. Innate and adaptive immune responses evolve as protective mechanisms against mycobacterial infection in humans. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane proteins characterized by an extracellular leucine-rich domain that participates in ligand recognition and an intracellular tail. TLRs are the first defense system to detect potential pathogens, initiate immune responses and form the crucial link between innate and adaptive immune systems. Stimulation of TLR initiates a signaling cascade that involves a number of proteins, such as MyD88 and IL-1 receptor-associated kinase. This signal cascade leads to NF-κB activation, which induce the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines.||TLR2 is a family of TLR family and has been reported to be the principle mediator of macrophage activation in response to mycobacterium. Growing amounts of data suggest that the ability of certain individuals to respond properly to TLR ligands may be impaired by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within TLR genes, resulting in an altered susceptibility to, or course of, infectious disease. The genetic polymorphism of TLR2 (arginine to glutamine substitution at residue 753 (Arg753Gln)) has been associated with a negative influence on TLR2 function, which may, in turn, determine the innate host response to mycobacteria. In addition, another polymorphism (Arg677Trp) of the TLR2 was reported to be associated with susceptibility to tuberculosis in Tunisian patients. Moreover, in Mycobacterium leprosy patients with TLR2 mutation (Arg677Trp), production of IL-2, IL-12, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha by M. leprae-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cell were decreased compared with that in groups with wild-type TLR2.||To date, there have been no studies of the association of SNPs of TLR2 with cytokine profiles and clinical outcomes on M. tuberculosis. We hypothesize that polymorphisms in the TLR2 are associated with :||increased prevalence of active pulmonary TB infection,|altered levels of pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines in serum,|clinical outcomes and presentations. We thus design a prospective case-control study to test this hypothesis. The frequency of TLR2 polymorphisms in both pulmonary TB patients and healthy controls will be determined by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Serial serum levels of IL-12, IFN-γ, and IL-10 in pulmonary TB patients with or without TLR2 polymorphisms will be measured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay.

The result has been a decrease in the pneumococcal infection rate among elderly contacts of these infants and decrease colonization with pneumococci. In order to determine the pneumococcal serotypes which are prevalent among infants attending day care centers (DCCs) in Jordan, a study of these types circulating among infants will be determined over a period of 15 months in 250-300 children attending the DCCs in Ajlun-City by taking 3 NP-swabs, the first before the first vaccine injection in May 2009, the second before the third injection at 10 months of age and the third swab sample is taken at 1 year of age (2-3 months after the last injection with the 7vPCV. The aims of this study were to determine the frequency of NP-carriage and serotype distribution of the strains isolated from infants less than 2 years old, and to get an insight about the coverage of the available and future pneumococcal conjugate vaccines developed for this infectious agent. Good results of this study project would make recommendations for the Ministry of Health (MOH) to include the vaccine in the National Vaccination Program. 15000 doses of the 7v PCV (Prevenar) were donated from Wyeth Pharmaceutical company to the MOH of Jordan in September 2008. These will be vaccinated in a vaccine program (for free) over 15 months period in 2009-2010 in one city in north Jordan called Ajlun. This city has 3676 births per year (Statistics of the MOH 2007). The vaccination program will start from the 18th of May, 2009, and ending in August 2010. The way the vaccine will be given is 2 + 1 injections as recommended by the vaccination committee of the MOH.","Streptococcus Pneumoniae","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","May 2009","October 2010","7 valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (7v-PCV) - Prevenar","Biological","Phase 1|Phase 2","All","2 Years","2 Months","Prevention","Single Group Assignment","Jordan","Randomized","377",,

Likewise, CAP due to S. pnemoniae is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections in humans worldwide and is associated with high morbidity and mortality in patients who suffer from it.||Pneumococcus frequently colonizes the nasopharynx of children and adults and, therefore, this condition has been postulated as a risk factor for the development of CAP. There are reports of the effect of nasopharyngeal colonization in infants, but the implications of this colonization in adults, especially adults with chronic comorbidities, are not known.||Additionally, several studies point to a relationship between pathogenicity, colonization capacity, and disease severity according to the infecting pneumococcal serotype. Therefore, it is not known which pneumococcal serotypes are most frequently colonized by adults with chronic diseases (cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), renal disease (RHD), rheumatological disease (MDR), Diabetes Mellitus (DM), among others) and the potential clinical implications of this colonization.||For these reasons, this research aims to study the phenomenon of colonization by pneumococcus in patients with chronic diseases for the development of CAP, and the relationship between the virulence genes of different serotypes and the outcome in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD).||This study is based on real evidence (from clinical practice) and translational medicine, is prospective-observational, multicenter and cohort type in consecutive patients.

TB is short for tuberculosis. Treating TB requires several months (usually 6 months) of treatment, with the first 2 months being intensive treatment with usually four medicines. Treatment is needed to keep the infection from getting worse and to prevent death from TB.||Vitamin D is a hormone present in the human body to manage levels of some essential electrolytes such as calcium and phosphate. Vitamin D is important for bone formation and prevention of bone breakdown (osteoporosis) as the investigators age. There is also new evidence that links vitamin D to function of our immune system as well. Even though our bodies can make vitamin D and can also obtain vitamin D from our diet, most adults, especially patients with tuberculosis have low vitamin D levels (are vitamin D deficient) that need to be corrected. Full correction of low vitamin D levels requires 6 weeks or more of weekly vitamin D supplements. There are several benefits to correcting vitamin D deficiency (better bone health, better balance of calcium and phosphate), but it is not known whether correcting vitamin D deficiency will lead to a better immune response to tuberculosis.

Since the epidemic outbreak of acute Q-fever in Holland nearly 4030 people have been registered with the acute form of the disease. Knowing that only 40% of all infected people develop symptoms, the number of infected people (and potential candidates for chronic Q-fever) are much higher. Chronic Q-fever generally manifest itself after a couple of months or years after the primary infection (in 1-5% of all cases). The clinical presentation can be a life-threatening and frequently underdiagnosed disease, as endocarditis, infected aneurysm and vascular prosthesis or chronic Q-fever related to pregnancy and immunecompromised patients. That's why a screening program is started in the endemic area and trace patients with chronic Q-fever. So eventually, a greater group of patients with chronic vascular Q-fever can be described.

Patients with C. difficile associated disease (CDAD) possess deficiencies in 'normal' fecal microbial composition, most likely as a result of earlier antibiotic usage. The current standard of care treatment for severe C. difficile, which consists of antibiotics, does not restore the microbiota. Restoration of the normal colonic microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may enable reversion colonic microbial population to a more 'normal'state and lead to cure.||A few patients develop severe CDAD which may be complicated by adynamic ileus, or toxic megacolon. The management in this context is based on limited data, and for some the only available option is sub-total colectomy.||Although FMT is by no means a new therapeutic modality, there is limited information on its use for the treatment of acute CDAD, including severe CDAD. Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with treatment of patients with severe CDAD, and because the evidence supporting the current recommendations is weak and based upon the demonstration that FMT is an effective strategy to re-establish a balanced intestinal microbiota with resultant cure of recurrent CDAD, we propose to study the efficacy and safety of FMT for severe CDAD.||Patients with severe CDAD can be divided into two operational groups; those that have diarrhea and those that suffer from adynamic ileus. We propose to apply FMT through colonoscopy for all patients because current data suggest that the overall success rate of FMT for recurrent CDAD with lower gastrointestinal tract FMT was higher than FMT through the upper gastrointestinal tract. In addition, for patients with adynamic ileus and toxic megacolon (i.e., the population with the highest CDAD-associated morbidity and mortality), intra-colonic FMT administration is the preferred alternative.","Clostridium Difficile","No","Interventional","April 2014","January 2016","fecal microbiota transplantation","Drug","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","Israel","N/A","3",,"1"

5120,"Completed","The efficacy and immunogenicity of enteric vaccines have generally been found to be lower in children in the developed than in the developing countries. This has been observed with vaccines against cholera rotavirus, ETEC and typhoid vaccines. There are a number of factors that may contribute to such differences in vaccine ""take rates"" in children, e.g. breast feeding and nutritional status of the children might influence their immunogenicity and efficacy. Thus, breast feeding of newborn and young infants may adversely influence the immune response to vaccination, which might have more pronounced effect in developing than in developed countries. Breastfeeding has also been shown to interfere with the serum immune responses to rotavirus vaccine although this effect could be overcome by administering three rather than one dose of the oral rotavirus vaccine. Our recent study of Dukoral in Bangladeshi children aged 18 months or younger has shown that the response rates and the magnitude of responses improved when breast milk was temporarily withheld . Thus, administration of vaccines may have to be adjusted when given to breast fed children. Another factor that may affect the immunogenicity is the effect of zinc. Previous studies have shown that zinc enhances the immune response to cholera vaccine in participants > 2 years of age , a recent study also observed a similar effect in infants.||In this research project, we plan to study a number of different factors that might influence the immunogenicity of the two licensed oral model vaccines, specifically the inactivated killed oral cholera vaccine, Dukoral, and the live oral typhoid vaccine, Ty21a.

This antibody transfer has been known for some time but has not been compared between the two whooping cough vaccines being used in pregnancy. Any effect the raised antibody might have on infant responses to the vaccines given in the first few months of life has also not been measured. This is particularly important as the infant immunisations include some of the same components as the whooping cough vaccines, which include diphtheria, tetanus and polio. Previous studies have shown that high levels of antibody prior to vaccination may affect subsequent antibody responses. It is therefore important to assess whether administration of the whooping cough vaccine in pregnancy adversely affects the protection afforded by the infant vaccines, particularly to those which are similar, namely tetanus and diphtheria as well as meningitis C and Hib vaccines which include diptheria and tetanus components in their structures. This study will assess immune responses of mothers and their babies (~200 pairs) to their vaccinations and will allow the comparison of two whooping cough vaccines being used in pregnancy. This will be done by taking small amounts of blood, which is the only way to measure antibody levels (the proxy of the immune response), before and after the vaccinations.

The CTC is defined as the storage and transport of vaccines within a temperature range appropriate to the heat stability profile of TT vaccine. In this study vaccines are transported and stored in the cold chain up to district level. From district to beneficiary level vaccines are exposed to ambient temperatures during a limited period of time.||In an initial phase, the stability of 3 lots of TT vaccine kept in CTC is determined. For this, the potency, safety, pH and adsorption of vaccines maintained in CTC will be tested in the laboratory and compared to vaccines that have been maintained in cold chain. If all parameters (i.e. potency, safety, pH and adsorption) are above WHO specifications the strategy in CTC will be used.||Only if the laboratory results are adequate, villages will be assigned to one of the vaccination strategies. All women between 14 to 49 years of age in the selected villages who fulfill the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate.||In order to determine the baseline anti-tetanus protection, TT vaccination history will be collected from all participants using a standardized questionnaire. Women who have already received at least 2 doses of TT vaccine will be excluded from the study. Moreover, blood will be collected from all participants to later verify in laboratory the baseline protection.||A first dose of TT vaccine will be given according to the assigned strategy (CTC or cold chain).

These forms of gluten intolerance represent a heterogeneous set of conditions, including celiac disease (CD), wheat allergy (WA) and not celiac gluten sensitivity (NCGS), that combined seems to affect about 5-10% of the general population. NCGS is the most recent gluten-related disease, characterized by intestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms related to the ingestion of gluten-containing food, in subjects in whom either celiac disease or wheat allergy previously has been excluded. However, as it is not known what component of the cereals causes the symptoms in NCGS patients, the investigators prefer the label of ""Not-celiac wheat sensitivity"" (NCWS). Typically, the NCWS diagnosis is made by exclusion. Furthermore, similarly to CD, the investigators had demonstrated that NCWS may be associated with other autoimmune disease (i.e. Hashimoto's thyroiditis). Among these autoimmune conditions, in our daily out clinic work, the investigators have observed an association between self-reported NCWS and Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF). Our preliminary observational data indicate that some FMF patients relate their symptoms (especially gastrointestinal) to gluten assumption, then excluding it from diet and using gluten-free products, with partial remission of gastrointestinal symptoms. Therefore, FMF and NCGS share some clinical features, such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, arthralgia and arthritis, and tend to be commonly associated with other inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. This study has 2 major aims: 1.To evaluate the real relationship between the wheat ingestion and the gastrointestinal manifestations presented by FMF patients, self-reporting a NCWS. 2.

5188,"Withdrawn","Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a genetic disease, caused by mutations in the FMF gene, entitled MEFV. The disease is characterized by painful attacks of inflammation in sites lined by serous membranes (e.g. abdominal pain caused by inflammation of the peritoneum, a serous membrane surrounding all internal organs within the abdomen). Continuous colchicine treatment prevents attacks in most patients. The pathogenesis of the disease, what leads to the attacks and how colchicine helps, are questions not yet resolved. Elucidating the role of the inflammatory proteins is an important step towards the understanding of these questions. To date only small numbers of cytokines and inflammatory proteins have been studied individually. We propose to study a large number of these proteins in the RNA and protein levels addressing the interaction between them and the effect of colchicine on their expression.||Blood samples will be drawn from consenting patients in remission, during attacks, under and without colchicine treatment. (20 patients in each category).Twenty healthy volunteers will donate control blood samples for the study. RNA will be produced from the neutrophils, and cytokines and various proteins' RNA expression will be determined. Major expressed proteins will be measured in the same samples and the results will be analyzed with regard to the activity of the disease, MEFV mutations and colchicine treatment status. The information obtained by the study may allow us to determine the sequence of events associated with FMF attack development, and perhaps take us one step further in the understanding of the pathogenesis of the disease.","Familial Mediterranean Fever","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","August 2008","August 2016",,,,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Israel",,"0",,
5189,"Completed","Autoinflammatory diseases are illnesses characterized by episodes of inflammation that, unlike autoimmune disorders, lack the production of high titer autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. There is growing genetic and clinical evidence that Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a pathogenic role in several of these diseases. This exploratory study aims to examine the utility of the experimental drug candidate, IL 1 Trap (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in the treatment of adult subjects with the autoinflammatory disorders Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), and Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS), Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), and adult Still's disease. FMF is associated with mutations in pyrin encoding MEFV. NOMID, MWS and FCAS are associated with mutations in cryopyrin-encoding CIAS1.||This pilot study is designed to address: 1) the utility of IL 1 Trap in the treatment of subjects with diseases known to respond to IL-1 blockade (NOMID/MWS/FCAS) as shown by response to treatment with anakinra [Kineret]; 2) the response to IL-1 blockade of subjects with Adult Still's disease and colchicine-resistant FMF once the efficacy of IL-1 Trap has been established in NOMID/MWS/FCAS subjects; and 3) the biochemistry and genetics of autoinflammatory diseases and IL-1 related inflammation.||IL-1 Trap is a recombinant fusion protein with picomolar affinity for IL-1 and a half-life of approximately 7.5 days in humans. This agent is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and initial studies have shown activity against clinical and biochemical indicators of inflammation. Compared with anakinra, this agent may exhibit improved dosing convenience, potential for fewer injection site reactions, and improved efficacy due to the extremely high affinity of IL-1Trap for its target.||In this study, biochemical, genetic, and clinical correlates of autoinflammatory disease will initially be measured at baseline following a withdrawal of any TNF or IL-1 inhibitor medications where applicable. Subjects will receive a course of therapy with IL-1 Trap that is predicted to provide an estimated 3-4 weeks of anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical, biochemical, and genetic correlates of inflammation will be measured at appropriate intervals to ascertain response and to further elucidate disease mechanisms. Subjects will be eligible, based on clinical response, to enter a 1- year extension phase with IL-1 Trap. Those subjects who complete the 1-year extension phase, and maintain improved clinical and laboratory parameters compared to baseline values, may continue to receive study medication at their current dose until the study drug is commercially available.||Investigator comment:||This protocol (from the NIH standpoint) is a continuation of the ongoing protocol 05-AR-0014, with a new change in study sponsor, the NIH replacing Regeneron as sponsor. this protocol therefore still contains background and procedural information that refer to patients with FMF and FCAS and or MWS and Still's disease, however only patients with Still's disease will be newly enrolled from this point on, enrollment for the FCAS and or MWS patients has already been completed and it has been decided to not enroll any more FMF patients because the number of subjects is too low to reach reasonable conclusions, in addition it has been difficult to recruit patients that are eligible.

5214,"Completed","SUMMARY||Rationale: Buruli ulcer, caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans, is an ulcerative disease endemic in West Africa. It often leads to functional limitations. Treatment was by extensive surgery, until in 2005 gradually antibiotic treatment for eight weeks with rifampicin and streptomycin was added. Observation of Buruli ulcer lesions of limited size during antibiotic treatment showed that during treatment there is a paradoxical increase of the lesion, with a decrease of the lesion after week 14. Current WHO protocols advise to decide whether surgery is needed four weeks after the start of antibiotics. This might be too early in the healing process. The investigators hypothesize that delay in surgery is safe, and that it results in a reduction of the number of surgical interventions.||Objectives:||Primary Objective of this study is to compare the need for surgical treatment in standard timing of surgery at the end of eight weeks antimicrobial treatment with a policy to postpone surgical treatment until week 14.||Secondary Objectives are to study whether postponing surgery leads to less extensive surgery and a change in frequency of functional limitations;||Study design:||Patients will be randomized for surgery at week 8 after start of antibiotic treatment and week 14 after start of treatment. Reasons for treating doctors to decide to intervene with surgery will be according to current clinical practice and will be clearly defined in this protocol.

In line with WHO guidelines, the Botswana Ministry of Health (MOH) and CDC rapidly rolled out the Xpert device and a new Xpert-based diagnostic algorithm in service of 22 HIV care and treatment clinics. To maximize impact of the Xpert device in improving detection of active TB, Xpert rollout was preceded by strengthening of TB screening procedures by: (1) adopting the WHO-recommended 4-symptom TB screen for adults; (2) situating trained TB case-finding nurses in facilities; and (3) training health facility personnel in TB diagnostic algorithms. The combination of these strengthened TB screening procedures and rollout of the Xpert device is referred to as the ""Xpert package"" in this protocol.||Key Evaluation Objectives: The protocol has two key objectives: (1) to evaluate whether the new MOH-recommended Xpert-based TB diagnostic algorithm for new adult HIV clinic enrollees is more sensitive than the pre-Xpert smear-microscopy-based algorithm in diagnosing culture-positive TB disease; and (2) to evaluate the impact of the whole ""Xpert package"" on all-cause mortality during the first 6 months of ART, among adult patients.||Design: Stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial.

Despite the introduction of the highly sensitive and specific GeneXpert MTB/RIF (GeneXpert) test [1] with a potential turn-around time of two hours, many people in high TB prevalence areas still do not have access to efficient TB diagnostic services due to logistical constraints in these settings. A cost effective, rapid, point-of-care screening test with high sensitivity would identify people with a high likelihood for active TB and would prioritize them for testing with more expensive, technically or logistically demanding assays including GeneXpert or liquid culture, facilitating cost-effective diagnostic work-up in resource-limited settings. A serum cytokine signature for active TB disease, discovered in the AE-TBC project, with a sensitivity of 89% (CI 78 - 95%) and specificity of 76% (CI 68 - 83%), will be optimised and utilized in a point-of-care format (TransDot) to rapidly test for TB disease in symptomatic people.||Hypothesis: The TransDot test will achieve a sensitivity of > 90% for TB disease, in a training set of people suspected of having TB disease, and be validated (achieve similarly high sensitivity) subsequently in a prospective test set of people suspected of having TB disease, when compared to a composite gold standard of sputum culture, smear, GeneXpert, chest X-ray, TB symptoms and TB treatment response.||Objectives: The overall objective of the study is to incorporate a six-marker serum signature into a multiplex UCP-LFA format, referred to as TransDot, for finger-prick blood testing.

It includes: 1) Point-of-care molecular testing using GeneXpert as a replacement for sputum smear microscopy; 2) Re-structuring of clinic-level procedures to facilitate same-day TB diagnosis and treatment; and 3) Quarterly feedback of TB evaluation metrics to health center staff. The investigators' central hypothesis is that the intervention strategy will have high uptake and increase the number of patients diagnosed with and treated for active pulmonary TB. To test this hypothesis, the investigators will conduct a pragmatic cluster-randomized trial at community health centers that provide TB microscopy services in Uganda in partnership with the National TB Program (NTP). The investigators utilize an effectiveness-implementation hybrid design in which, concurrent with the clinical trial, the investigators will conduct nested mixed methods, health economic and modeling studies to assess 1) whether the intervention strategy modifies targeted barriers to TB diagnostic evaluation; 2) fidelity of implementation of the intervention components (i.e, the degree to which intervention components were implemented as intended vs. adapted across sites); and 3) cost-effectiveness and public health impact.","Tuberculosis, Pulmonary|Rifampicin Resistant Tuberculosis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","October 22, 2018","April 1, 2022","GeneXpert I|Process re-design|Performance Feedback","Device|Behavioral|Other","Not Applicable","All","100 Years","18 Years","Diagnostic","Parallel Assignment","Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda|Uganda","Randomized","11337",,

Therefore in the recent years, interest has been generated regarding the role of adjuvant immunomodulating therapy for the treatment of TB.||WHO has classified tuberculosis by disease severity into 3 distinct categories; mild, moderate and severe according to clinical presentations and host factors.

Independent of it's effects on bone mineralization, vitamin D is recognized to have numerous immune modulating effects; some specific to mycobacterium tuberculosis. Therefore vitamin D may enhance the host immune responses against the pathogen. Vitamin D status can be accurately determined by measuring the serum levels of 25-(OH) D3. A recent systemic review and meta-analysis explored the association between low serum vitamin D and risk of active tuberculosis and concluded that patients with tuberculosis have lower serum levels of vitamin D than healthy controls when matched for sex, age, ethnicity, diet and geographical location.||Vitamin D deficiency is not a life threatening condition.

Acellular pertussis vaccination (aP) replaced whole cell vaccination against pertussis (wP) in the late 1990s. This replacement coincides temporally in an observed rapid rise in the occurrence of severe food allergy responses. Previous research has suggested that acellular pertussis vaccination results in the development of immunity that may predispose children to allergic responses. A retrospective case-controlled trial design, targeting cases of previously diagnosed allergy, and comparing case vaccination history to that of the whole population, is a powerful means of assessing the association between immunisation and allergy.||Participant Groups 1000 allergy cases, 10,000 controls||Project Design This is a retrospective individually-matched case-control study of Australian children born during the period of transition from use of wP vaccines to aP vaccines (year of birth 1997-1999 inclusive) and who are registered on the Australian Children Immunisation Register. Cases will be drawn from allergy clinics associated with tertiary teaching hospitals around Australia.||Methods Cases: will be retrospectively identified from patient lists from allergy clinics around Australia, born during the period of pertussis vaccine changeover, and be confirmed to have IgE-mediated food allergy on the basis of 1) a documented history of consistent clinical symptoms following ingestion of an implicated food, and 2) evidence of sensitisation to that food via laboratory testing.||Controls: Controls will be sampled from a de-identified database of children born during the transition from wP to aP vaccination appearing on the ACIR. Cases and controls will be matched by date of birth (+/-7 days), jurisdiction and socioeconomic decile.||Expected outcomes: Following the study, investigators will be able determine if there is an association between the type of vaccination received and development of IgE mediated food allergy.

The Diabetes Mellitus-(DM) is also on rise in Pakistan and people suffering from DM are more prone to catch TB as compared to healthy individuals. This concurrence of two outbreaks may further increase the frequency of TB in Pakistan. The TB DM co-occurrence results in various clinical issues as TB in DM patient increases blood glucose, making DM more difficult to treat, while DM raises the risk of treatment failure, relapse and death among TB patients. In addition, both DM and TB usually coexist with micronutrients deficiencies like vitamin D, which has a vital role in immunity, insulin functioning and respiratory health. It has been suggested that the combined supplementation with vitamin D and calcium might be beneficial in improving the glucose metabolism but the current knowledge is very limited.

Current management includes prolonged intravenous antibiotic therapy, but there is limited evidence to guide oral conversion. The implicated K1/K2 capsule strain of Klebsiella pneumoniae is almost universally susceptible to ciprofloxacin, an antibiotic with high oral bioavailability. Our primary aim is to compare the efficacy of early (<1 week) step-down to oral antibiotics, to continuing 4 weeks of intravenous antibiotics, in patients with Klebsiella liver abscess.||Methods/Design: The study is designed as a multi-centre randomised open-label active comparator-controlled non-inferiority trial, with a non-inferiority margin of 12%. Eligible participants will be inpatients over the age of 21 with a CT or ultrasound scan suggestive of a liver abscess, and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from abscess fluid or blood. Randomisation into intervention or active control arms will be performed with a 1:1 allocation ratio. Participants randomised to the active control arm will receive IV ceftriaxone 2 grams daily to complete a total of 4 weeks of IV antibiotics. Participants randomised to the intervention arm will be immediately converted to oral ciprofloxacin 750mg twice daily. At week 4, all participants will have abdominal imaging and be assessed for clinical response (CRP <20 mg/l, absence of fever, plus scan showing that the maximal diameter of the abscess has reduced). If criteria are met, antibiotics are stopped; if not, oral antibiotics are continued, with reassessment for clinical response fortnightly. If criteria for clinical response are met by week 12, the primary endpoint of clinical cure is met. A cost analysis will be performed to assess the cost saving of early conversion to oral antibiotics, and a quality-of-life analysis will be performed to assess if treatment with oral antibiotics is less burdensome than prolonged IV antibiotics.||Discussion: Our results would help inform local and international practice guidelines regarding the optimal antibiotic management of Klebsiella liver abscess. A finding of non-inferiority may translate to the wider adoption of a more cost-effective strategy that reduces hospital length of stay and improves patient-centered outcomes and satisfaction.","Liver Abscess, Pyogenic","No","Interventional","November 5, 2013","January 16, 2018","Ciprofloxacin|Ceftriaxone|Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole|Ertapenem","Drug|Drug|Drug|Drug","Phase 4","All",,"21 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Singapore|Singapore|Singapore","Randomized","152",,

EBUS-TBNA allows the mediastinal lymph nodes to be targeted in the areas accessible to cervical mediastinoscopy, as well as some hilar nodes (lymph node stations 2-4, 7, 10-12). Currently, the main indication of EBUS-TBNA is the mediastinal nodal staging of NSCLC after recent meta-analyses established the comparable sensitivity and specificity of nodal staging by EBUS-TBNA and cervical mediastinoscopy. Theoretically, mediastnial tuberculous lymphadenopathy could be diagnosed by the method of EBUS-TBNA. Douglas F. Johnson was the first doctor to report 2 cases of mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenopathy diagnosed by EBUS-TBNA in 2009. There are currently no much data on the use of this technique in this field. The investigators plan to perform a prospective single-center study to investigate the diagnostic efficacy of mediastinal tuberculous lymphadenopathy by sampling the culprit nodes via EBUS-TBNA. Concomitant sputum specimen for acid-fast stain and mycobacterial culture were collected as well.","Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy|Tuberculous Mediastinal Lymphadenopathy","No","Observational","April 2010","April 2012","endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration","Procedure",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Taiwan",,"50",,

These children experience a chronic course of the disease impacting on their quality of life and family functioning. Their medical treatment is significant and may last for life. Caring for these children involves a multidisciplinary approach. Control of the disease and management of the symptoms becomes of foremost importance to minimise disability and pain. In addition to medical care, the supporting role of nurses in the care of children with rheumatic diseases and their family aims to limit the potential for further deformity, disability, and psychological complications. In particular, they play a key role in supporting the specialist team caring for patients with rheumatism disease, recognising poor disease control and the need for changes in treatment, providing a resource to patients on treatment options and how to access additional support and advice, and identifying best practice to achieve optimal outcomes for the patients and their family. Nurses also ensure the link between medical practitioner, other health providers, and family, thus play a key role in the follow-up care of the child and its family. Follow-up of children and their family can be ensured by regular telephone consultation (telenursing) made by experienced nurse specialists in rheumatology.

The methodological approach is based on the comparison between the production of toxins by a given S. lugdunensis isolate classified in patients groups according to the infection clinically defined. Each group will be compared to the presence or not of studied virulence factors. Clinical features associated with toxin activity are not known for S. lugdunensis. This comparative approach is based on the hypotheses that drove to the definition of patient groups and their clinical criteria. However, in the absence of the evident correlation between production of toxins and kind of infection, the statistical evaluation will be completed by a multi-varied analysis. This approach has not been choosen first because of the multiple parameters that undergo during infection that may reveal relationships without true correlation. About the number of included patients in each defined group, if one of them does not reach the expected count, we still might extend inclusions to 3-6 months more. The presence of severe infections without usually defined risk is intriguing. For these last patients, we have planned, after their individual consent to achieve an exome sequencing. The obtained data will be compared to available resources for the human genome.

5670,"Unknown status","Rheumatic heart disease (RHD) affects at least 32.9 million people, mostly children living in low-resource settings. Long-term intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) prophylaxis is proven to prevent progression of chronic valve changes in patients with established rheumatic heart disease (RHD) and to allow regression of valve changes in patients with a history of acute rheumatic fever (ARF) with mild RHD. However, in low-resource settings ARF is an elusive diagnosis, and most patients (85%) are diagnosed only when RHD is severe and irreversible, medications ineffective, and surgical intervention is expensive and/or unavailable.||Identification of latent RHD might be an opportunity to substantially reduce RHD morbidity and mortality. However, detection of latent RHD is only important if outcomes are improved. The appropriate management of children with latent RHD is unknown and no formal recommendations exist. While some clinicians prescribe penicillin prophylaxis for children with latent RHD, clinical equipoise exists regarding the best practice.||To fill this gap, the investigators propose a randomized controlled trial in children with latent RHD to evaluate the efficacy of BPG prophylaxis compared to no prophylaxis. Our primary outcome measure is progression of valvular changes on echocardiogram at 2 years. A sample size of 916 children is needed to detect a 50% reduction of progression (expected range 7.5-12.5% progression in BPG-arm vs. 15%-25% progression in control-arm) with 90% power.||AIM 1: To compare the proportion of children (aged 5-17 years) with latent RHD receiving BPG prophylaxis who progress to worse valvular disease at 2-years compared to children not receiving BPG prophylaxis.||Hypothesis 1: Prophylaxis with BPG will result in fewer children with latent RHD showing progression of echocardiographic valve changes at 2 years compared to children with latent RHD not receiving BPG prophylaxis. (The investigators expect at least a 50% relative reduction in progression in the BPG arm: range 15%-25% control arm vs. 7.5-12.5% BPG-arm.)||AIM 2: To compare the proportion of children (aged 5-17 years) with latent RHD receiving BPG prophylaxis who regress to improved valvular disease at 2-years compared to children not receiving BPG prophylaxis.||Hypothesis 2: Prophylaxis with BPG will result in more children with latent RHD showing regression of echocardiographic valve changes by 2 years compared to children with latent RHD not receiving BPG prophylaxis. (The investigators expect at least a 50% relative increase in regression in the BPG arm: range 10-20% control arm vs. 20-40% BPG arm.)||This study is highly significant because it will establish if BPG prophylaxis improves outcomes for children with latent RHD. Feasibility will be ensured through the experience, resources, community support, and accessible patient population of our investigational team. The results of our study will have high impact, immediately informing international policy on the standard of care for children diagnosed with latent RHD and shaping, over 2-3 years, practical and scalable programs that could substantially decrease the global burden of RHD.","Rheumatic Heart Disease in Children|Latent Rheumatic Heart Disease|Rheumatic Heart Disease|Heart Diseases","No","Interventional","June 26, 2018","November 30, 2020","intramuscular benzathine penicillin G (BPG) prophylaxis","Drug","Phase 2","All","17 Years","5 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Uganda","Randomized","807",,

It has become evident that the likelihood of immune interference (in response to conjugated- or co-administered antigens) increases in proportional to the number of glyco-conjugates (valencies) and dosages of carrier proteins. There are many kinds of carrier proteins: tetanus toxoid (TT), diphtheria toxoid (DT), CRM197 (non-toxic variant of DT), OMP (complex outer-membrane protein mixture from Neisseria meningitidis) and non-typeable Hemophilus influenza-derived protein D. Among them, TT is a more potent inducer of T-helper immunity, but carrier-induced-epitopic suppression (dose-dependent carrier antibody and carrier B cell dominance) may occur with TT. In comparison, DT and CRM197 are weaker B-cell immunogens, but apparently trigger more T-regulatory mechanism.

5772,"Completed","Rationale||In Belgium, a unique situation exists for two reasons: on the one hand, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) program, which started in 2007, has quickly reached high coverage in infants: 3-dose coverage rose from 89 % in 2008 to 96.5 % in 2012 in Flanders and from 80.7 % in 2009 to 89.2 % in 2012 in Wallonia; and on the other hand, serotype coverage has moved from PCV7 (since 2007) to PCV13 (since 2011) and very recently to PCV10 (since July 2015 in Flanders and expected in May 2016 in the French Community). Invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) surveillance has demonstrated a major impact on PCV13 serotypes in infants < 2 years of age. The impact of the current change in PCV-program is hard to predict, but could eventually result in a re-emergence of serotypes not covered by PCV10 (i.e. 3, 6A and 19A).||With this unique situation the foundation was laid for a carriage study during which the nasopharyngeal carriage of Streptococcus pneumonia (Sp) and other common colonizers of the nasopharynx will be studied in infants with acute otitis media (AOM) and in healthy infants attending day-care centers (DCC), two populations with high reported pneumococcal carriage. Young children are an important reservoir and major source of transmission of bacteria to the whole community and thus the preferred population to study nasopharyngeal (NP) carriage.||Aim of the study||The main aim of this study is to evaluate if changes in the conjugate anti-pneumococcal vaccination program in Belgium have an impact on the nasopharyngeal carriage of Pneumococcus in infants aged 6-30 months suffering from AOM or attending day-care, in order to guide future pneumococcal vaccine program decisions and vaccine development, and to feed AOM treatment guidelines in a PCV-program environment. The study will monitor overall pneumococcal carriage, the serotypes involved and the sensitivity of the isolated strains to antibiotics. In addition, the rhinopharyngeal carriage of other common nasopharyngeal colonizers associated with disease, in particular Haemophilus influenzae, will be studied in order to evaluate if changes in pneumococcal carriage impact on the carriage of those pathogens. In infants with AOM, the study will also monitor the clinical course of the AOM and a second nasopharyngeal sample will be taken in case of antibiotic treatment failure or AOM recurrence to identify any association with the carried pathogen.","Streptococcus Pneumoniae|Nasopharyngeal Carriage","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","October 2015","December 2018","Nasopharyngeal sampling with a swab","Other","Not Applicable","All","30 Months","6 Months","Other","Parallel Assignment","Belgium","Non-Randomized","2817",,

5778,"Not yet recruiting","Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) have been shown to be effective against invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD; including pneumococcal meningitis and sepsis) and all-cause mortality among young children when introduced into infant expanded programs on immunization (EPI). Colonization of the nasopharynx by Streptococcus pneumoniae is a necessary prerequisite to pneumococcal disease. Critically important to the population impact of PCV is therefore reducing vaccine serotype (VT) carriage prevalence, and therefore reducing both disease and onward transmission to vulnerable individuals. Thus, as well as protecting the vaccinated individual (direct protection), PCV confers indirect protection (herd immunity) to unvaccinated populations and to vaccinated individuals who have insufficient protective immunity.||While the ability of PCVs to induce herd immunity has been strong enough to control pneumococcal carriage in industrialized countries, such benefits have not been as marked in low-income countries. Carriage surveillance in Blantyre, Malawi from 4 to 7 years post-vaccine implementation shows persistent VT carriage. With the exception of South Africa, most sub-Saharan African countries, including Malawi, have introduced PCV using a 3+0 schedule. Whether the WHO-approved 2+1 schedule will maximize vaccine-induced protection has been identified as a research gap by the WHO. In this context, the Malawian Ministry of Health (MoH) and the National Immunizations Technical Advisory Committee (NITAG) are seeking evidence of adequate superiority of a 2+1 schedule to inform a change to the current Malawi EPI schedule.||HYPOTHESIS: Prolonging the period of vaccine-induced protection with a booster vaccine dose at 9 months will extend the period of low VT carriage, hence providing longer direct vaccine-induced protection as well as boosting the indirect herd immunity effect.||METHOD: The MoH will implement an evaluation, comparing a 2+1 to the current 3+0 PCV13 vaccine schedule in Blantyre District. This will use a pragmatic health centre-based randomization protocol, implemented within the scope of the EPI programme. This MoH-led change will be evaluated in partnership with the Malawi Liverpool Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Programme. Community carriage surveillance will be undertaken at 15 and 33 months after the introduction of the 2+1 schedule.||The primary endpoint will be VT carriage prevalence among children 15-24 months of age 36 months after schedule change. Other targeted study groups will include children aged 5-10 years who have received PCV13 on a 3+0 schedule, children aged 9 months who have received PCV13 in either a 3+0 or a 2+0 schedule, and HIV-infected adults aged 18-40 years receiving ART and PCV13-unvaccinated.||EXPECTED FINDINGS: Data will inform NITAG decisions on national vaccine policy, with implications at a national, regional and global level.","13-valent Pneumococcal Vaccine|Streptococcus Pneumoniae","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","January 1, 2022","September 30, 2024","nasopharyngeal swab","Other",,"All","40 Years","15 Months",,,"Malawi",,"5900",,

This strategy consisted in conjugated 13-valent pneumococcal injection followed 2 months later by polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine injection. General practitioners are usually in charge of this vaccination. Conjugated pneumococcal vaccine enhances the immunogenicity of the polysaccharide vaccine. Acute leukemia and lymphoma are treated with multiple courses of chemotherapy, impairing the immune system and potentially the response to vaccination. These patients are more at risk for developing pneumococcal invasive diseases than the general population. However, efficacy of pneumococcal vaccination is poorly documented in this setting. We assume that 70% of the patients are non-responders to vaccination, according to their anti-pneumococcal immunoglobulin G titers and the opsonophagocytic activity. To assess the immunogenicity of the pneumococcal vaccination combined strategy in adult population of acute leukemia and lymphoma, the investigator will measure anti-pneumococcal serotype-specific immunoglobulin G titers and opsonophagocytic activity at different time-points after completion of the combined vaccine strategy. The primary objective is to assess the immunogenicity of pneumococcal vaccination combined strategy at 3 months after the 13-valent pneumococcal injection (corresponding to 1 month after the end of the combined strategy) using immunoglobulin G titers and opsonophagocytic activity. At different time points (day 0, 1 month after the 13-valent pneumococcal injection, the day of the injection of the polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine, one month after the injection of the polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine, 3-6 months after the polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine,9-12 months after the polysaccharide 23-valent vaccine), the immunological response to vaccination will be monitored using specific-serotype immunoglobulin G titers, opsonophagocytic activity, and total anti-pneumococcal Immunoglobulin.

5904,"Unknown status","Hidradenitis suppurativa or Verneuil's disease (HS) is a neglected and often overlooked chronic inflammatory skin disease. Nevertheless, it is frequent (1% of the general population) and deeply affects quality of life in patients with moderate and severe forms of HS. This disease is characterized by the occurrence of deep, recurrent and painful nodules, progressing to abscess formation and suppuration. It is usually localized in the axillary, inguinal and anogenital areas. The pathogenesis of HS remains partly unknown but is probably multifactorial (inflammatory, genetic, infectious, etc.) and related to many risk factors (mostly smoking and obesity). An association can be found with other inflammatory diseases such as gastrointestinal and rheumatic diseases like Crohn's disease and spondylo-arthritis respectively.||Periodontal diseases are a heterogeneous group of infectious diseases with an inflammatory component. Their clinical expression results in more or less rapid destruction of tooth supporting tissues. Without treatment, these lesions may progress ultimately to tooth exfoliation, the rate of disease progression being unevenly distributed in the population. Various epidemiological studies in France indicate that 12 to 13% of middle-aged adults have severe periodontal damage. In addition, a recent study shows that while 50% of adults in France are suffering from severe attachment loss, generalized forms are rare and about 10% of individuals seem to require special care. The bacterial factor is the main etiological factor of these diseases but their progression depends primarily on the host immune response and on modifying factors (genetic, systemic, environmental and behavioural). Some of these factors are identified such as uncontrolled diabetes, smoking, stress, etc.. Finally, it is well established that periodontal disease may also trigger the development of some systemic diseases such as diabetes.||Thus, many common etiopathogenic factors between HS and periodontal diseases such as inflammatory components and tobacco are found. This is corroborated by observations collected from some patients with HS complaining of oral pain exacerbated during acute flares of HS. Hence the aim of this project is to clarify existing potential association between Hidradenitis suppurativa and periodontal diseases using a multicenter cross-sectional descriptive clinical approach.||One hundred patients with HS will be included in the departments of dermatology at the University Hospital in Reims and at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. They will be compared with one hundred patients without HS recruited from ""general practice"" consultations in the departments of Odontology at the University Hospital in Reims and at Bretonneau Hospital in Paris.||The severity of HS will be assessed with Hurley's score by the dermatologist. The periodontal status will be evaluated with clinical indices and radiographical parameters by a periodontist according to the ""Armitage"" classification of periodontal disease and to CDC-AA case definitions updated in 2012. Meanwhile, human saliva is a biological fluid taken to reflect the health status of an individual and is or may be used for diagnosis and prognosis of some oral cancers, some systemic diseases (type 2 diabetes, sarcoidosis, etc.) or periodontal diseases. The saliva will be collected and analysed by proteomics and metabolomics techniques in order to identify biomarkers for diagnosis and prognostic of HS associated or not to periodontal diseases.||These unpublished works could demonstrate a predisposition to develop periodontal disease in a subgroup of HS patients and help to unravel new etiopathogenic mechanisms common to both diseases as well as ultimately lead to early periodontal management in order to avoid disease progression and tooth losses.","Hidradenitis Suppurativa|Periodontal Diseases","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","May 7, 2018","May 7, 2020",,,,"All",,"18 Years",,,"France",,"200",,

5907,"Completed","In modern-day medicine, the use of central venous catheters has become unavoidable. However, their use does not come without risk. It puts patients in danger of infectious complications (catheter-related infections [CRI]), the most important of which is catheter-related bloodstream infection (CRBSI). CRBSI is associated with a significant increase in hospital stay and, therefore, cost of patient management, morbidity, and probably also mortality. There still is an urgent need for effective, cheap and easy to implement measures to prevent CRI that are without risk of developing antibiotic resistance.||During use, bacteria can colonize the inner surface of the catheter. This endoluminal route of infection can be prevented to some extent when an antibiotic solution is instilled in the catheter for a long enough time and on a regular basis. However, to avoid resistance from occurring, the use of antibiotics for infection prevention should remain exceptional.||The use of a non-toxic antiseptic might be a better alternative. Recently, the use of an alcohol lock solution was suggested as a promising way to prevent CRBSI and the compatibility of polyurethane and silicone catheters submerged in an alcohol solution was publicized with no biomechanical or structural changes detected after 9 weeks of immersion. The major advantage of an alcohol lock solution would be the broad antimicrobial spectrum without the risk of compromising future antibiotic treatment as, in contrast to the use of an antibiotic lock, the development of antibiotic resistance is not of concern.

5950,"Terminated","Appropriate delivery of adequate nutrition and medications in premature infants often requires central venous access in the form of a special IV called a PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter). While a necessary feature of neonatal intensive care, PICCs pose significant risk: among the most serious of these is infection. One common, successful infection control practice used in older children and adults involves the use of a lock, in which a fluid-filled syringe is attached to the end of an IV when it is not in use in order to prevent and/or treat clotting or infection. The solution is left for some period of time and is then either withdrawn from the line or flushed into the patient. The solution could be saline, antibiotics, other antiseptics, or any combination of these. However in the premature infant, use of antibiotics as a locking compound risks leaving behind organisms resistant to treatment; antiseptics can irritate vessels and cause breakage to sensitive premature skin; saline has neither sterilization nor anti-infective properties. By contrast, ethanol neutralizes or kills most bacteria, viruses, and fungi without the risk of resistance, and because it is not externally applied there is no risk to baby skin. Ethanol-based lock protocols have been used safely and effectively in both adult and pediatric populations without adverse effects, but this has not been tested in premature babies because fluids and medication are delivered continuously: placement of a lock traditionally requires an extended pause (hours or days) in fluid and medication administration.||To overcome these key limitations, a periodic, brief ethanol lock protocol was designed such that both infant exposure and interruptions to fluid and medication delivery would be minimized. The lock is practical, cheap, easy to place, and takes advantage of an existing daily pause during which IV tubing and fluids hooked up to the PICC are changed. The objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that use of a 70% ethanol lock, every 3rd day, for 15 minutes, will safely and effectively reduce PICC infection in our unit.","Infection Associated With Catheter|Bacteremia|Sepsis","No","Interventional","February 2010",,"Ethanol lock|Heparinized saline","Drug|Drug","Not Applicable","All","32 Weeks",,"Prevention","Parallel Assignment","United States","Randomized","10",,

VAP is defined as pneumonia occurring 48 hours after patients receive mechanical ventilation, including pneumonia occurring within 48 hours after extubation. It is one of the important causes of hospital-acquired infection, and the incidence of VAP in children on mechanical ventilation is about 10%, or 7/1000 days of mechanical ventilation, and the overall mortality is 10-24%.Research has so far explained the relationship between bacteria isolated from human biological samples and VAP pathogens. Most studies are limited to the level of bacterial species, and there are few reports on bacterial genotyping, and there is a lack of scientific basis for the pathogenesis of VAP caused by bacteria in ventilator pipeline. The aim of the study is to investigate pathogen of the sputum in deep respiratory tract of patients with mechanical ventilation in PICU by the means of second generation sequencing (NGS).","VAP - Ventilator Associated Pneumonia","No","Observational","September 2021","June 2023","mNGS diagnose of VAP","Diagnostic Test",,"All","18 Years",,,,,,"400",,

5989,"Completed","The first time the American Heart Association (AHA) suggested that disinfection of the gingival sulcus be performed as a complement to antibiotic prophylaxis in patients considered to be at risk of Infective endocarditis (IE) was in their protocol for the prevention of IE published in 1977. This practice was included by the AHA and adopted by other expert committees such as the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) in subsequent prophylactic regimens. In 1992, the BSAC specified the presentation and concentration of chlorhexidine (CHX) that should be used before starting the dental procedure: 1% gel at the gingival margin or 0.2% mouthwash for five minutes. In 1997, the AHA recognised the need to use antiseptic mouthwashes (CHX or povidone iodine) prior to dental manipulations, although they recommended against the use of gingival irrigators and against the continuous use of antiseptics in order to avoid the selection of resistant micro-organisms In 2006, the BSAC recommended a single mouthwash with 0.2% CHX gluconate (10 ml for 1 minute) before performing dental procedures associated with bacteraemia in patients at risk of IE. In contrast, in 2007, the AHA recommended against the use of any antiseptic prophylaxis protocol.||In 2008, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence of the United Kingdom recently performed a systematic review of the antimicrobial prophylaxis protocols for IE and reported that: ""Oral chlorhexidine used as an oral rinse does not significantly reduce the level of bacteraemia following dental procedures"". This conclusion was reached after analysis of numerous studies on the efficacy of prophylaxis with CHX for the prevention of post-dental manipulation bacteraemia. However, those studies presented significant methodological differences not only in the dental procedures performed, but also in the concentration of CHX applied and the method of application of the antiseptic solution (mouthwash and/or irrigation), making comparison of the results of the different series difficult.||There are few studies that have analysed the efficacy of the mouthwash of 0.2% CHX (the concentration recommended by the BSAC) in the prevention of post-extraction bacteraemia. Only one study analysed the combination of local irrigation and mouthwash with chlorhexidine before dental extraction, but with a really lower concentration of CHX, only 0.02%.||The objective of this study is to investigate the prevalence, duration and aetiology of bacteraemia secondary to a single tooth extraction after prophylaxis with different CHX protocols.","Bacteremia|Tooth Extraction Status Nos","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","December 2010","June 2012","0.2% Chlorhexidine|1% Chlorhexidine|1% Chlorhexidine|Blood extraction|Lidocaine plus adrenaline|Tooth extraction","Drug|Drug|Drug|Procedure|Drug|Procedure","Phase 4","All",,"18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Portugal|Spain","Randomized","208",,

Condition,BriefSummary
cirrhosis,"In this prospective randomized controlled trial we aim to evaluate the impact of vitamin C on AKI outcomes in patients with cirrhosis and MDR infections. We also aim to evaluate the effects of iv vitamin c on systemic hemodynamics (cardiac output and systemic vascular resistive index, extravascular lung water and lung permeability index), endothelial function and coagulation, microcirculation (as assessed by lactate clearance and central venous oxygen saturation), mitochondrial function, 28-day mortality and vasopressor, ventilator and RRT free days in the ICU. The safety and side-effects of vitamin c would also be evaluated.||Patients with suspected (nosocomial acquisition) or proven MDR infections would be screened and randomized to two groups who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria.||Group 1: Will receive iv vitamin C (25 mg/kg or max. 1.5 gram every 6 hourly) for maximum 5 days along with iv antibiotics as per institutional protocol Group 2: iv antibiotics alone"
cirrhosis,"Patients with cirrhosis present an increased susceptibility to bacterial infections. Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the most frequent infection and induces severe circulatory dysfunction associated with renal failure in about 30% of cases. Renal failure is a reliable surrogate marker of in-hospital mortality in patients with SBP or with non-SBP infections. Albumin, as an adjuvant to antibiotherapy reduces significantly the rate of renal failure, in-hospital mortality, and overall mortality (Sort P, et al. NEJM 1999). However, little is known regarding the effect of albumin administration in patients with non-SBP infections. Two recent prospective studies demonstrated that non-SBP infections are associated with impairment of the effective circulating volume and precipitate renal failure whatever the presence of ascites.||The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of albumin, associated with appropriate antibiotic therapy, on occurrence or deterioration of renal failure and survival in septic (SIRS criteria required) cirrhotic patients with non-SBP infections and presenting with a Child-Pugh score > 8."
cirrhosis,"Bacterial infections are a frequent complication in liver cirrhosis with a bad prognosis. However, the clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients with serious infections is significantly improved over the last 30 years due to early diagnosis and to the use of a more appropriate antibiotic therapy.||As in the general population, empirical treatment should be initiated soon after diagnosis, after making the necessary sampling and should be based on the use of an antibiotic with low toxicity and broad spectrum antibacterial efficacy, taking into account the local epidemiology and prevalence of antibiotic resistance.||The third generation cephalosporins are considered the gold standard in the treatment of most infections in cirrhotics due to their effectiveness against enterobacteriaceae and against non-enterococcal streptococci and due to their low toxicity.||However, the recommendations for the antibiotic therapy are currently based on results of trials of '80s and '90s, when the proportion of resistant pathogens was lower. Similarly to nosocomial infections, the increasing rate of infections due to multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria represents the rational for a different choice of empirical antibiotic therapy with a higher resistance barrier. This change in the epidemiology of community acquired infections is mainly due to the increased contacts with healthcare system of these patients and for the larger use of antibiotic prophylaxis. With this regard, it was recently proposed to introduce a third epidemiological class of infection ""Health care-associated"": Infections occurring in community in patients who have been in contact with the health system shortly before the infection.||This epidemiological class of infection should be distinguished from ""community-acquired"" because they are more similar to""nosocomial"" in terms of their sensitivity to antibiotics. Therefore for this class should be taken into consideration the use of a different empirical antibiotic therapy.||The investigators aim was to evaluate prospectively the effectiveness of a broad spectrum antibiotic treatment in a cohort of cirrhotic patients with ""healthcare-Associated""infections||Cirrhotic patients with ""Healthcare Associated"" admitted to the gastroenterology department of the Policlinico Umberto I and in the Department of Hepatology of the Hospital of Marino will be consecutively enrolled.||Randomized controlled trial with randomisation stratified by epidemiological class of infection."
cirrhosis,"Study Design:||Double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial||Study Duration:||2 years||Study Center:||Single center Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Barcelona||Objectives:||To assess the effect of Vivomixx® on neuroinflammation and systemic inflammatory response in patients with cirrhosis"
cirrhosis,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) present in cirrhotic patients induces severe circulatory dysfunction, which results in renal failure in up to 30% of the patients. Renal failure is an important prognostic marker, representing the major predictive factor of in-hospital mortality.||Recent studies have shown that plasma volume expansion with albumin associated with cefotaxime in patients with SBP is more efficient to prevent renal failure than cefotaxime treatment alone. The in-hospital and three-month mortality rates, furthermore, were significantly lower in the group treated with albumin.||It is not known if other bacterial infections unrelated to SBP represent a risk factor for the development of renal failure among cirrhotic patients. The researcher's group has recently performed a study to evaluate the incidence, characteristics and outcome, of renal failure in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infections unrelated to SBP associated with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (Terra, unpublished results). Among a total of 106 patients, 29 (27%) presented renal failure during the course of infection. Renal failure was characterized by intense renal vasoconstriction (intrarenal resistive index of 0.83 +/- 0.09, measured by Doppler ultrasound), reduction of mean arterial pressure and an important activation of endogenous vasoconstriction systems. The three-month survival probability of patients with infection and renal failure was 34 %, much lower than that of patients with infection but not presenting renal failure (87%, p<0.0001). These results suggest that the development of renal failure in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infections different from SBP, associated with signs of a systemic inflammatory response, is very frequent and results in a very poor prognosis. Taken as a whole, these data strongly indicate the need to consider these patients as candidates for liver transplantation and to plan strategies for its prevention.||The objective of this project, therefore, is to evaluate if the plasma volume expansion with albumin, associated with conventional antibiotic therapy, can prevent the development of renal failure and increase survival rates in cirrhotic patients with bacterial infections unrelated to spontaneous bacterial peritonitis."
cirrhosis,"In patients with cirrhosis and liver failure, pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF alpha) might be responsible of severe complications and death. Thus, the prevention of cytokine production should prevent complications and mortality.||The aim of this study is to study the 2 months survival rate in patients with severe cirrhosis (Child-Pugh C) with pentoxifylline - an inhibitor of cytokine production. The 6 month mortality, the proportion of transplanted patients, the occurrence of complications (bacterial infection, renal failure, hepatic encephalopathy and gastrointestinal bleeding), plasma cytokine levels and fibrotest - a marker of fibrosis - will be also studied. This is a multicenter double blind randomized trial with a placebo.||All adult patients with severe cirrhosis might be randomized after written consent. Patients with severe carcinoma, intolerance or contraindication to pentoxifylline will not be included. Patients receive either pentoxifylline or placebo 3 times a day for 6 months. Three hundred and forty two patients are necessary to decrease mortality rate by 50% at 2 months in a beta risk of 10% and an alpha risk of 5%. Patients will be seen every month."
cirrhosis,"Hepatitis C is the leading cause of chronic liver disease and cirrhosis in United States veterans. Cirrhosis is associated with impaired antibody responses and increased risk of bacterial infections. We have recently identified that cirrhosis is associated with abnormalities of memory B-cells, cells that make antibodies and help protect against bacterial infections. We have identified that chemicals associated with gut bacteria might play a role in causing these B-cell abnormalities. It is well known that gut bacteria have increased access to the blood in individuals with cirrhosis, a process called bacterial translocation. We hypothesize that reducing bacteria counts in the gut by using poorly-absorbed antibiotics (also known as selective gut decontamination) will partially reverse losses of memory B-cells in cirrhosis by reducing bacterial translocation."
cirrhosis,"Probiotics, due to their ability to modulate intestinal flora, intestinal permeability and immune response, could decrease bacterial translocation and improve immune system alterations in cirrhosis. This could lead not only to improvement in liver function and to prevent bacterial infections and other complications but also to improve CD and to avoid its consequences falls, HRQoL deterioration).||Recently, the investigators have observed that VSL#3 administration to rats with experimental cirrhosis decreases bacterial translocation, inflammatory response and ascites formation, without changes in intestinal flora. This suggests an improvement in intestinal barrier that deserves further investigation.||VSL#3, through decreasing intestinal bacterial translocation and immune system modulation, could improve cognitive function and prevent the consequences of CD, including falls and HRQoL deterioration, in patients with cirrhosis."
cirrhosis,"Acquired dysfunctional immunity in cirrhosis predisposes patients to frequent bacterial infections contributing to disease progression and may lead to the development of acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF). Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is one of the most frequent infections in cirrhosis and therefore a trigger for ACLF. ACLF is characterized by systemic inflammation even in the absence of confirmed infection and associated with poor outcome. The source of ascites infection, especially in case of culture-positive SBP and bacterascites, is suspected to be bacterial translocation from gut.||In decompensated cirrhosis, data on the gut microbial translocation in different circulatory compartments is limited. Moreover, the link between gut microbiome and systemic inflammation in liver disease has still not established.||The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is applied to treat portal hypertension which frequently leads to intestinal bleeding, life-threatening esophageal bleeding and ascites. Under the procedure of TIPS, the vein blood samples in different compartments (superior mesenteric vein, portal vein and hepatic vein) from patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis are available. Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS) is a promise approach for the diagnosis of infectious disease because a comprehensive spectrum of potential causes (viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic) can be identified by a single assay. Previous study reported that mNGS of cerebrospinal fluid can be applied to diagnosis of meningitis and encephalitis. Comparing to traditional bacterial culture method, mNGS method is more sensitive and rapidly in pathogen detection. Therefore, the circulating microbiome in different compartment can be characterized by means of mNGS.||Here, the study aim to investigate the circulating microbiome from superior mesenteric vein (first venous outflow in gut-liver axis), hepatic vein (liver outflow), peripheral vein and ascites from patients with decompensated liver cirrhosis receiving TIPS. Before TIPS, fecal sample and unary sample are collected. And mNGS method is performed to identify the pathogen in ascites,fecal and blood samples in a single center. Ultimately, the study aim to build up the link between gut microbiome translocation and liver disease."
cirrhosis,"In this pilot study, the investigators aim to assess feasibility of subject identification and data collection, including specimen processing, as well as the rate of enrollment for a future, larger study of the effect of empiric antibiotics for all patients with advanced cirrhosis admitted to the hospital without an existing indication for new antibiotic use. Specifically, the investigators will assess the incidence of infection after the time of enrollment and associated outcomes. Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive antibiotics vs placebo."
cirrhosis,"Intervention: All patients at presentation would be assessed for the underlying cause of and will be managed by removal of all precipitants(careful review of medications, diuretics, nephrotoxic drugs,vasodilators or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). The second step would be to consider plasma volume expansion in patients with hypovolemia (the choice of fluid could either be a crystalloid or albumin or even blood as indicated) along with identification and early treatment of bacterial infections. Along with this patients with a differential diagnosis of HRS-AKI would be given terlipressin ( or noradrenaline/octreotide midodrine in case of contraindication to terlipressin). Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ATN would be randomized to the on-demand versus protocol-guided dialysis groups. Further, patients with urine output of less than 0.5ml/kg/hour for 4-6 hours despite adequate fluid resuscitation and vasoconstrictors would also be subjected to randomization.||In the on-demand group patients would get dialysis only when patient fulfills absolute criteria requiring dialysis such as metabolic acidosis with ph<7.2, hyperkalemia, refractory fluid overload (non-responsive to diuretics) or oliguria with urine output of less than 0.5ml/kg for more than 24-48 hours from the time of randomization|In the protocol guided group patients all patients would be considered for dialysis within 6 hours of randomization After randomization patients would receive dialysis as three sessions per week of at least 4 h with a blood flow >200 mL/min and a dialysate flow >500 mL/min in intermittent group and as 20-25 mL/kg/h of effluent, by filtration and/or diffusion in continuous form until recovery of renal functions"
cirrhosis,"The current prospective randomized controlled trial would aim to study the efficacy of targeted albumin therapy versus standard medical treatment in reduction in 6-month mortality in recurrent ascites in patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Additionally, we aim to evaluate the efficacy of albumin in decreasing the incidence of complications: paracentesis induced circulatory dysfunction (PICD), AKI, hyponatremia, bacterial infections, hepatic encephalopathy and variceal bleed, impact on systemic hemodynamics and portal pressures, renal reserve as assessed by biomarkers and on immunomodulation. In this open labeled randomized study, consecutive cirrhotic patients, fulfilling the inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study.||The patients will be randomized to 2 groups by the clinical trial coordinator (CTC). The CTC will be blind to the patient and treatment received, and the allocation concealment by the sequentially numbered opaque sealed envelopes (SNOSE) technique would be done. Patients would be assessed every 2 weeks for first 8 weeks with serum albumin levels, ascites grade and use of diuretics and then every 3 months. The treatment would receive targeted albumin therapy as detailed in methods while patients in the other group would receive standard medical treatment. The primary outcome of the study would be evaluation of 6-month mortality while secondary outcome measures would be the incidence of liver-related complications at 3, 6 and 12 months, survival free of liver transplant and TIPS in both groups at 6 months and 1 year, improvement in quality of Life as assessed by short form survey-36 version (SF-36) at 6 and 12 months, improvement in renal reserve (as assessed by renal biomarkers) at 3, 6 and 12 months, reduction in the frequency of large volume paracentesis at 3, 6 and 12 months and change in immune parameters at 3 and 6 months."
cirrhosis,"Patients with cirrhosis are particularly prone to infection which is frequently a precipitant of hepatic encephalopathy, renal failure and circulatory collapse. Bacterial infections are of particular concern in patients with cirrhosis because they are poorly tolerated. Sepsis and associated endotoxaemia whereby bacteria produce inflammatory particles occur in approximately 40% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and is a major cause of death.||Gut-derived and blood-borne pathogens can induce an inflammatory response within the liver and spleen, which are the major organs that remove bacteria and their endotoxin (such as lipopolysaccharide - LPS and bacterial DNA itself) from the bloodstream. Several mechanisms have been identified and proposed in this process which depends upon a balance between the barrier functions of the gut and the 'detoxifying' capacity of the liver. People with established liver cirrhosis have been shown to have escape of endotoxin into the bloodstream produced by bacteria that reside in their intestines, which becomes more permeable or 'leaky'.||Gut dysfunction is defined by changes in the types of bacteria within the gut and in overall permeability allowing bacterial products which would otherwise be contained within the gut to travel into the bloodstream and lymphatic system with detrimental effects elsewhere in the body. This passage of bacterial products is termed bacterial translocation, and it's effects on the liver and general immune system can be then be measured.||It has now become recognised that certain types of white blood cells such as neutrophils and monocytes become dysfunctional and this predisposes to infection and may also have a more direct pathogenic role in hepatic encephalopathy. Thus neutrophil and monocytes may be a novel pharmacotherapeutic target in a condition where current therapies such as bowel aperients (e.g. lactulose) are inadequate. A therapeutic strategy utilising Rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic, to modulate gut bacterial which produce ammonia, a chemical known to be important in the cause of hepatic encephalopathy, could potentially lower gut-derived systemic inflammation, endotoxaemia, infection and organ dysfunction in this population improving outcomes and prolonging transplant-free survival.||We therefore plan to test if Rifaximin positively affects markers of immune dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis experiencing chronic hepatic encephalopathy after 30 days of treatment, as our primary research question.||Positive results from this study would support further trials into the potential benefit of using Rifaximin to improve immune function, as well as reduce the recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy, in patients with liver cirrhosis."
cirrhosis,"Periodontitis is common in patients with cirrhosis and may lead to systemic sepsis. 1 Grønkjær et al demonstrated that severe periodontitis predicted higher mortality in patients with cirrhosis. 2 In India, the wide use of oral tobacco, smoking and poor dental hygiene fosters a dual hit to the outcomes of liver disease especially in the setting of liver transplantation. However, a causal relationship between the oral microbiome and liver disease and outcomes is a matter of conjecture. Oral bacterial diseases, such as caries and periodontitis are caused by a consortium of bacteria rather than a single species. These constitute opportunistic infections that occur under the proper circumstances and conditions, e.g., diet, host immune response, complicating systemic or genetic disorders, pH, poor oral hygiene and lifestyle. It is well known that specific bacterial taxa that colonize the oral cavity are associated with oral health and oral diseases or afflictions, such as dental caries, periodontal diseases, endodontic lesions, dry socket, halitosis, and odontogenic infections.||Bajaj et al have demonstrated systematic periodontal therapy in cirrhotic outpatients improved endotoxemia, as well as systemic and local inflammation, and modulated salivary and stool microbial dysbiosis over 30 days. Bajaj et al performed another study on comparison of oral and gut microbiota in patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy.||There were differences in salivary microbiota composition and inflammatory markers between controls and cirrhotics. The association between periodontitis, oral dysbiosis and the prognosis of cirrhosis remains crucial with relevance to situations like acute-on-chronic liver failure and other inflammation-related adverse events."
cirrhosis,"Liver transplantation has been universally recognized to improve survival of patients suffering from end-stage (Pugh C) alcoholic cirrhosis. However, for Pugh B patients, the benefit of liver transplantation remains to be demonstrated. The aim of the present study was to compare the outcome of Pugh B patients with alcoholic cirrhosis randomly assigned for immediate liver transplantation (group 1) or standard treatments (group 2)."
cirrhosis,"Patients with advanced cirrhosis have abnormal translocation of Gram-negative bacteria across the intestinal barrier and subsequent systemic inflammatory response. We hypothesized that this translocation may worsen the underlying liver disease. Thus, the aim of this trial was to assess the effects of the oral administration of norfloxacin (an antibiotic that suppresses intestinal Gram-negative bacteria) on the development of complications of cirrhosis."
cirrhosis,The purpose of this study is to determine whether steroid-related complications can be avoided by using steroid-free immuno-suppressive drug regimen after liver transplantation.
cirrhosis,"Study population: Decompensated cirrhotics requiring primary prophylaxis with asciteswho are admitted to and attending the OPD at ILBS.||Study Design : A Randomized controlled trial Study period : August 2019 to December 2020 (1.5 Years) Intervention : Treatment naïve patients will be given Propranolol and dose will be titrated every 2ndday to attain a target heart rate of 55.||One group patients will be given maximum tolerated dose of propranolol with initial dosage of 20mg once a day and uptitrating every 2nd day by 20 mg.The patients who bleed will undergo EVL session.||To the other group Midodine will be added to Propranolol.It will be started at 2.5mg TDS and will be uptitrated every 2nd day to a max of 10mg TDS to attain a MAP of atleast 70mm Hg and then uptitate the beta blocker simulataneously to attain the target heart rate. The patients who bleed will undergo EVL session.||Monitoring and assessment :||The patient will be monitored every day.

cirrhosis,"Research question: Do oral probiotics in patients with cirrhosis and ascites reduce intestinal bacterial concentrations, ascitic bacterial DNA, SBP and bacteraemia compared to antibiotics or placebo?||This study is designed to investigate the effects of an oral probiotic (VSL#3; a mixture of ""healthy"" bacteria for the intestines) compared to an antibiotic or placebo in preventing infection developing in the abdominal fluid (""ascites"") that collects in patients with advanced liver disease (""cirrhosis""). Patients already having had infection will be excluded from the study. Clear inclusion and exclusion criteria will be met and patients will be monitored throughout the study to examine whether they have required more hospitalisations, their rate infection in abdominal fluid or elsewhere and the level of liver function."
cirrhosis,"Thrombosis occurring in the small intrahepatic, as well as in the large vessels is involved in the progression of cirrhosis. Anticoagulation could reduce morbidity and mortality in cirrhotic patients"
cirrhosis,"Liver cirrhosis is the 10th most common cause of death in the western world. Infection is the most common precipitant of deterioration of liver function in cirrhosis. Endotoxin, derived from gram-negative organisms in the gut, can enter the circulation due to increased gut permeability and contributes to neutrophil dysfunction, infection risk and mortality in alcoholic cirrhotics. As probiotics decrease gram-negative organisms in the gut and/or decrease gut permeability, the investigators hypothesize that probiotic treatment would restore neutrophil function and prevent infection in alcoholic cirrhosis.||The investigators hypothesize that administration of a probiotic mixture in patients with liver cirrhosis will improve innate immune function through alteration of the gut bacterial flora and gut barrier integrity.||The aim of this randomised, double-blinded placebo-controlled study is to assess whether food supplementation with probiotic mixture improves neutrophil phagocytic capacity in patients with cirrhosis and decreases the incidence of significant infections.||92 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis will be included according to a sample size calculation from preliminary data. Patients will be randomized in two groups: Group 1 receives a probiotic mixture Group 2 receives a similar looking and tasting placebo without bacteria. The recruited patients will be treated for 6 months. Besides routine clinical and laboratory assessments, neutrophil function, toll-like receptor expression, endotoxin levels, bacterial DNA, cytokine levels, albumin oxidation, gut permeability and analysis of gut microflora will be performed. Furthermore nutritional status and quality of life will be assessed.||Primary endpoints will be neutrophil phagocytosis. Secondary endpoints will be significant infection, neutrophil oxidative burst, neutrophil toll-like receptor expression, endotoxin levels, bacterial DNA; cytokine levels, albumin oxidation, gut barrier function and bacterial flora, nutritional status and quality of life.||If our hypothesis holds true, probiotics will provide an easily applicable and cost effective method to improve immune function and to prevent infection in liver cirrhosis. It is possible that this can improve survival of patients with liver cirrhosis."
cirrhosis,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common and frequently fatal complication of end-stage liver disease with a mortality of up to 10%, primarily due to the development of kidney failure. Current standard practice is to treat this infection with broad spectrum antibiotics and salt-poor albumin administration on day one and three of treatment. In this study the investigators test the hypothesis that the administration of a second dose of albumin at 48 hours only to patients with renal insufficiency, is as effective at preventing kidney failure as administering the second dose to all patients at 72 hours."
cirrhosis,"The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether Viusid, a nutritional supplement, reduce the mortality and the complications (ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic encephalopathy, gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis and hepatocellular carcinoma) of patients with cirrhosis of the liver secondary to HCV infection in comparison with placebo, during 96 weeks of treatment."
cirrhosis,"Advanced liver disease and low ascitic fluid protein concentration have been identified as risk factors for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in cirrhosis. Moreover, renal impairment and hyponatremia increase mortality rate of this infection. Aims: To investigate if oral administration of norfloxacin prevents the first episode of SBP, hepatorenal syndrome and improves survival in cirrhotic patients with ascites and low protein concentration in ascitic fluid (<15 g/L) and at least one of the following inclusion criteria: functional renal failure (serum creatinine ≥ 1,2 mg/dl or BUN ≥ 25 mg/dl), hyponatremia (serum sodium ≤ 130 mEq/L) or advanced liver disease (Child ≥ 9 points with serum bilirubin ≥ 3 mg/dl). Methods: Prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial comparing oral norfloxacin (400 mg/d; n=35) with placebo (n=35)."
cirrhosis,"Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is one of the most serious complications of liver cirrhosis. Mainstay of treatment for SBP is use of proper antibiotics. Although, several antibiotics including cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, or ciprofloxacin are being used, it is unclear which drug is most effective. Our aim of study is to compare the efficacy of the three current antibiotics for the treatment of SBP in patients with liver cirrhosis.||The primary hypothesis is that the efficacy of all the antibiotics will not significantly different. This is non-inferiority trial."
cirrhosis,"This study is aimed to assess the efficacy of Human derived Transfer factor ( T-lymphocytes homogenate that contains small molecular weight (10 kDa) molecules: various IFNs, ILs, chemokines, endorfins, heat shock proteins) in decreasing rate and/or severity of infections in acute or chronic decompensations of liver cirrhosis and acute on chronic liver failure.."
sepsis,"Approximately one-third of neonatal deaths in developing countries are due to infections acquired through the birth canal and/or exposure to an unclean environment soon after birth. Current World Health Organization recommendations for the management of infants younger than 2 months of age who have serious bacterial infections involve hospitalization and parenteral therapy for at least 10 days with antibiotic regimens containing penicillin or ampicillin combined with an aminoglycoside.However, in many settings throughout the developing world, this is not currently possible, nor is this standard of care likely to be feasible in the near future. Several studies have reported that for a variety of sociocultural reasons many families are unable or unwilling to access hospital-based care and their sick young infants do not get hospitalized, and instead, receive a variety of home-based antibiotic therapies, or none at all. In our community field sites, approximately 70% of families refuse hospital referral for a sick newborn, despite provision of transport.||Thus, there is an urgent need to define the role of community/first-level facility-based care versus hospitalization for the management of young infants with serious bacterial infections, and the potential for community-based parenteral antibiotics as an alternative strategy in resource poor areas with high neonatal mortality rates. Bang and colleagues have demonstrated significant reductions in neonatal mortality from infections in an underdeveloped rural district in Maharashtra, India by a field-based case management approach which used oral cotrimoxazole and intramuscular gentamicin given for 7 days as treatment for neonates with sepsis.||This study is an equivalence randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing once daily IM ceftriaxone injection to once daily IM procaine penicillin and gentamicin injection, to once daily intramuscular gentamicin injection and twice daily oral cotrimoxazole, given for 7 days in babies with clinically-diagnosed possible serious bacterial infection (pneumonia, or sepsis with or without local infections such as skin or umbilical infections) whose families refused referral to a hospital. After supplementary informed consent, patients meeting specific inclusion and exclusion criteria are randomly allocated to one of the three regimens being tested. The study hypothesis is that all 3 regimens will perform equally well in the treatment of sepsis in a first-level facility setting."
sepsis,"Infections are the important cause of high mortality in young infants in developing countries. Zinc is a crucial micronutrient as it influences various immune mechanisms and modulates host resistance to several pathogens. It has shown benefits as an adjunct therapy in infections like diarrhea and pneumonia in older children Given the predisposition of young infants in developing countries to zinc deficiency and infections, addition of zinc to standard treatment of serious bacterial infections may lead to significant improvements in the outcomes.||Several hypotheses will be examined in this clinical trial. The primary objective is to measure, in a double blind randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of giving 2 RDA (Required Daily Allowance 10 mg) of zinc orally in addition to routine antibiotics, for treatment of possible serious bacterial infection in infants >= 7 days and up to 4 months of age in reducing the proportion of treatment failures and time to discharge from the hospital. This will evaluate the clinical consequences of the possible immunomodulation by zinc supplementation. This is critical to demonstrate because nearly 80% of infant mortality occurs in first months of life.||Young infants with possible serious bacterial infections fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study and stratified into 4 groups on basis of weight for age 'z' scores < -2 z and >=- 2 z and whether he/she has diarrhea or not. Within each stratum the subjects will be randomized to receive zinc or placebo. Treatment failures will be defined by the need for a change of initial antibiotic therapy. The minimum duration of monitoring will be till clinical recovery (using predetermined criteria). Serum copper, serum ferritin and serum transferrin receptors will be determined at enrollment, 72 hours after enrollment and at discharge from the hospital. Concentrations of CRP and procalcitonin will be measured at baseline, 72 hours after enrolment and at clinical recovery.||Documentation of efficacy of addition of zinc to standard therapy may provide a simple and low-cost strategy to improve survival in serious infections in young infants. This is likely to have a significant impact on infant morbidity and mortality. It will be good example of using a simple immunomodulator beneficially in improving child health."

The investigators objective was to assess whether the decrease in procalcitonin levels could be used to reduce the antibiotic therapy in critically ill patients with a proven infection without risking a worse outcome."
sepsis,"Sepsis sometimes occurs in people who have a serious infection. It is caused by toxic substances (toxins) from bacteria and other germs entering your bloodstream. Most people with sepsis will recover with routine medical care before the illness gets more serious. However, in some people, sepsis does become more serious. This severe sepsis can cause damage to internal organs (such as your heart, lungs, kidneys, and liver) and can be life threatening. Special natural fats, (called 'lipoproteins') in our blood are thought to help protect us from the toxins produced by bacteria during sepsis. Levels of these lipoproteins are often low in people with sepsis and this may make it more difficult to recover from the disease. GR270773 is a new drug that has been developed to help the lipoproteins in protecting the body against toxins. GR270773 is made from purified fats and oils from the soyabean and does not contain cholesterol.

sepsis,"Sepsis is the leading cause of death in intensive care units and a major public health concern in the world. Heparin, a widely used anticoagulant medicine to prevent or treat thrombotic disorders, has been demonstrated to prevent organ damage and lethality in experimental sepsis models. However, the efficacy of heparin in the treatment of clinical sepsis is not consistent. Caspase-11, a cytosolic receptor of LPS, triggers lethal immune responses in sepsis. Recently, we have revealed that heparin prevents cytosolic delivery of LPS and caspase-11 activation in sepsis through inhibiting the heparanase-mediated glycocalyx degradation and the HMGB1- LPS interaction, which is independent of its anticoagulant properties. In our study, it is found that heparin treatment could prevent lethal responses in endotoxemia or Gram-negative sepsis, while caspase-11 deficiency or heparin treatment failed to confer protection against sepsis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, a type of Gram-positive bacterium. It is probably that other pathogens such as Gram-positive bacteria might cause death through mechanisms distinct from that of Gram-negative bacteria. Peptidoglycan, a cell-wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, can cause DIC and impair survival in primates by activating both extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways, which might not be targeted by heparin. We speculate that the discrepancy between the previous clinical trials of heparin might be due to the difference in infected pathogens. Thus, stratification of patients based on the type of invading pathogens might improve the therapeutic efficiency of heparin in sepsis, and this merits future investigations."
sepsis,"The study aims to compare the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of an optimised dosing to a standard dosing regimen of vancomycin in neonates and infants aged ≤ 90 days with late onset bacterial sepsis known or suspected to be caused by Gram-positive microorganisms"
sepsis,"Bacterial infections can progress to a life-threatening illness called septic shock, characterized by low blood pressure and vital organ damage. The syndrome is thought to be caused by parts of the bacteria and by the body s own immune response to the infection. A major bacterial product that interacts with the immune defenses is called endotoxin. This study will examine the body s response to endotoxin in the lungs or bloodstream. When endotoxin is given in small amounts to humans, even though it is not an infection, it triggers a set of responses that are typical of what one would see with a true bacterial infection. This allows us to study the earliest changes in molecules and cells that are involved in some bacterial infections. This type of model is safe and has been used in humans for many years to understand the body s responses during infections.||Normal volunteers 18 to 45 years of age may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a history and physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG) and chest X-ray. In addition, volunteers 40 to 45 years old will have an exercise stress test to screen for asymptomatic coronary artery disease. Participants will undergo one or more of the following procedures:||Bronchoscopy, Bronchoalveolar Lavage, Bronchial Brushings, and Endobronchial Mucosal Biopsies: These techniques for examining lung function are used routinely in patient care and clinical research. The mouth and nasal and lung airways are numbed with an anesthetic. A bronchoscope (pencil-thin flexible tube) is then passed through the nose into the large airways of the lung. Cells and secretions from the airways are rinsed with salt water (bronchoalveolar lavage) and a flexible brush the size of a pencil tip is passed through the bronchoscope to scrape cells lining the airways. Lastly, pieces of tissue (the size of the ball of a ballpoint pen) lining the airways are removed for examination under the microscope.||Intravenous Endotoxin: A small dose of endotoxin is injected into a vein. Blood samples are drawn at regular intervals for 8 hours after the injection and again after 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 days to analyze the body s immune response to the bacteria in the blood.||Instilled Endotoxin in the Lungs: A small amount (2 teaspoons) of salt water is squirted through a bronchoscope into a lobe of one lung, and then salt water containing a small dose of endotoxin is squirted into the other lung. Bronchial lavage, brushing, and biopsy (see above) are then done to study the response of the lung to the endotoxin. In addition, air is withdrawn through the bronchoscope to study air components from the lung that was instilled with salt water or endotoxin.||Nitric Oxide Therapy: Endotoxin is instilled in a lung (see above) and then nitric oxide a colorless, odorless, tasteless gas mixed with room air in a concentration of 40 parts per million, is given through a cushioned mask placed over the mouth and nose. (Some participants will be given the nitric oxide mixture and others will breathe only room air through the mask to test the effects of the nitric oxide on the lung inflammation.) The mask will be worn continuously for 6 hours and removed before repeat bronchoscopy with lavage, brushing and biopsy.||Some of the above procedures require placement of a catheter (thin plastic tube) in a wrist artery to monitor blood pressure from heartbeat to heartbeat and to collect blood samples. First, the skin is numbed with an anesthetic (lidocaine). A needle is then inserted into the artery, the catheter is slipped over the needle into the vessel, and the needle is removed."
sepsis,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether use of the disinfectant chlorhexidine administered to the birth canal during labour and newborn at delivery can protect a woman and her baby from bacterial infections after birth. If effective, this could be used as an inexpensive alternative to antibiotics to prevent newborn infections in resource-poor countries."
sepsis,"The performance and clinical impact of two diagnostic systems will be evaluated using whole blood samples that are collected in parallel with samples for blood culture. As the rapid diagnostic systems will have the largest impact on severely ill patients (in need of a fast diagnosis) with bacterial infection, the evaluation will be performed in patients suspected of bacteraemia. During the study the new systems will be used in parallel with routine blood cultures. In alternating periods of 1 month, the results of the diagnostic system will be communicated to treating physicians (intervention) or not revealed (control). Blood culture results will be reported throughout the complete study period. Patients with suspected sepsis at the Emergency Department (ED), the department of infectious diseases/nephrology, and the department of haemodialysis will be included. In routine care, two blood culture sets (2x2 bottles) per patient are collected. One extra blood sample (EDTA tube, 9 ml of blood) will be sampled for each routine set of blood cultures. In addition, the clinical data of the patients will be collected. The samples will be sent to the clinical laboratory where samples are tested with the new systems during regular working hours in batches of 8 samples per run (2-3 runs per day). On average, 10%-20% of the blood cultures drawn on the presumption of bacteraemia yield bacterial pathogens. Previous data show that 13% of patients yield positive blood cultures. Thus, in order to collect blood samples of 100 new episodes of bacteraemia approximately 1000 patients (2000 blood cultures + 1000 EDTA tubes) have to be collected for each system (2000 patients in total). The results of the systems will be used to evaluate the clinical utility of the system regarding time to antibiotic treatment change and bacteraemia management. The system will be used directly for the diagnosis of patients, resulting in a possible change of treatment strategy. However, routine blood culture practices will still be done during the whole study period."
sepsis,"Though maternal and neonatal health are high priority areas for international development, maternal and neonatal mortality remain unacceptably high. Worldwide there are 1 million maternal and 4 million neonatal deaths every year and half of them occur in sub-Saharan Africa.||Post-partum and neonatal severe bacterial infections, namely sepsis, are leading causes of maternal and neonatal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Newborns can be infected during labour - when passing through the birth canal - and also during the first days/weeks of life, as a consequence of the close physical contact with the mother, when the latter carriers bacteria. As the mother is an important source of bacterial transmission to the newborn, treating mothers with antibiotics during labour should decrease their bacterial carriage and therefore lower transmission to the newborn. As carriage is a necessary step towards severe disease, this intervention should in turn result in the lower occurrence of severe bacterial disease and mortality during the neonatal period.||In many high-income countries, pregnant women are screened during pregnancy for vaginal carriage of Group B Streptococcus, the bacteria responsible for the vast majority of neonatal sepsis in the developed world. If women are carriers, they are treated with intravenous antibiotics during labour to decrease the risk of severe disease to their off-spring. Although this intervention has been successful in developed countries, infrastructure and resource limitations in regions like sub-Saharan Africa prevent both screening and use of intravenous antibiotics. Also, in Africa several bacterial pathogens are responsible for neonatal sepsis and the antibiotics needed in the continent should cover a wider number of bacteria; and ideally cover also bacteria responsible for severe post-partum disease in the mother.||We will conduct a large trial in West Africa, The Gambia and Burkina Faso, with the main objective of determining if a single dose of an oral antibiotic given to women during labour decreases newborn mortality. The trial will also assess the effect of the antibiotic on lowering newborns and maternal hospitalization during the first week's post-partum. We have selected an antibiotic (azithromycin) that in sub-Saharan Africa has already been used for elimination of other prevalent diseases such as trachoma. This antibiotic is safe, requires a single oral administration, has no special storage requirements and has the potential to eliminate most of the bacteria commonly causing severe disease in newborns and post-partum women in the continent. Very important this antibiotic is not widely used in clinical care in the continent, and therefore, any temporal increase of resistance induced by the intervention should not have implications on current treatment guidelines.||Before going to the large trial proposed here (12,000 women to be recruited), we have generated robust preliminary data on the effect of the intervention in a proof-of-concept trial conducted in The Gambia (829 women and their offspring recruited). We found that in fact, babies born from mothers who had taken this antibiotic during labour were less likely to carry bacteria that can potentially cause severe disease. These babies were also three times less likely to have bacterial skin infections or umbilical infections, both highly common among African newborns. Besides, fever or mastitis (again both very common in the region) during the post-partum period were four times lower among mothers who had taken the antibiotic during labour. Such trial confirmed our hypothesis of impact on bacterial transmission but it was too small to assess the effect of the antibiotic on mortality and hospitalizations. The preliminary trial also showed that women from the azithromycin group were less likely to need antibiotics for treatment infections during the puerperal period, decreasing then the pressure on the scarcity of antibiotics available in the continent.||The advantages of our approach are its simplicity, low cost and the possibility of protecting both mothers and babies with the same intervention."
sepsis,"Severe bacterial infections affecting multiple body organs, called severe sepsis (including meningococcal sepsis), remain an important cause of death and disability among children. Although early recognition, powerful antibiotics, and good intensive care have improved outcome, we need new ways to further reduce the number of deaths. Research in adults has shown that steroid replacement therapy might be useful. However, children are known to respond differently to adults and a definitive trial in children is needed because of the potentially harmful as well as beneficial effects of steroids.||This pilot study will provide the necessary information to allow the rational design of a large trial conducted at multiple hospitals investigating the role of corticosteroid replacement therapy in childhood sepsis. The study will provide information on how to measure the effects of steroids, information on length of therapy and a better understanding of how steroids work in children. The results emerging from this study will ultimately allow paediatric intensive care clinicians to know whether or not steroids are safe and/or useful.||The primary objective of this open-label study is therefore to gather clinical and laboratory data with which to inform the design of a large phase 3 double blind randomised controlled trial (RCT). The study will provide basic limited safety data, information on length of therapy and an assessment of possible clinical and laboratory endpoints to be used in addition to mortality.||Definition of sepsis:||Presence of a documented infection (eg clinical evidence of pneumonia, skin or soft tissue infection, purpura fulminans, urinary tract infection, abdominal infection) or a diagnostic positive blood culture (community or hospital acquired) within the last 72 hours and at least two of the following, one of which must be abnormal temperature or leucocyte count[3] core temperature of >38.5°C or <36°C; tachycardia (mean heart rate >2 SD above normal for age); mean respiratory rate > 2 SD above normal for age; leucocyte count elevated or depressed for age.||Definition of severe sepsis:||Sepsis plus cardiovascular organ dysfunction (the need for at least 5mcg/kg/min dopamine or dobutamine, or any amount of adrenaline or noradrenaline support), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), or 2 or more other organ dysfunctions."
sepsis,"Sepsis is a constant concern in ICU, frequent and severe, it requires early diagnosis and prompt implementation of the etiological treatment. The bacterial infections are the most common and are associated with high morbidity and mortality. Diagnosis is based on the detection of micro-organisms (bacteria) that can confirm the diagnosis and to tailor antibiotic treatments. Blood cultures are positive in 30-35% of cases and diagnosis is often based on a body of evidence that the use of biomarkers. No biomarkers (or even a combination of biomarkers) no evidence to confirm or refute the diagnosis of sepsis alone. During sepsis, gram + and gram - are circulating and often present in small amounts; they can be detected by sensitive and specific tools following a pretreatment of the blood sample (innovative technology Bacti-DIAG).||The main objective of the multicentre study Bacti-DIAG-Rea is testing in prospectively, in a suspicious population resuscitation of sepsis, this new bacterial biomarker. Secondary objectives will assess whether Bacti-DIAG provides time and precision gain (gram + vs grams) in the patient's care including diagnosis and treatment.||All ICU patients and with clinical criteria of Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome (SIRS) sepsis suspects will be included: in addition to the samples taken for routine care of the patient 4 tubes of whole blood will be collected 5mL. The definitive diagnosis of sepsis or SIRS be confirmed retrospectively by two independent experts blinded to Bacti-DIAG. The areas under the ROC curves for the detection of gram + and gram will be calculated and associated detection limits will be determined to meet the objectives of the study.||It is planned to include 400 consecutive patients with SIRS criteria for sepsis 300-360 and analyze biometric and biological data based on the subsequent evolution of the patients. The care of patients will be blinded to the results of the new biomarker Bacti-DIAG"
sepsis,"The purpose of the study is to evaluate the role of antibiotics in preventing infection in babies born through meconium stained amniotic fluid. Normally babies do not pass meconium while in utero. In response to hypoxic stress babies may pass meconium before birth and are likely to be candidates for problems related to meconium passage and its inhalation. It is believed that these babies are more prone to infections as meconium enhances bacterial growth and may predispose such babies to secondary bacterial infections. In addition, meconium passage has been incriminated as a pointer of in-utero infection. Whether use of antibiotics in babies born through meconium stained amniotic fluid will reduce the infectious episodes and complications thereof or not is not clear. Moreover, there is not much published literature to prove or refute the same. Most clinicians have a low threshold for using antibiotics in such babies. In view of the uncertainty regarding antibiotic usage in these babies, the investigators decided to investigate the role of prophylactic antibiotics in prevention of neonatal sepsis in babies born through meconium stained amniotic fluid."
sepsis,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of a probiotic foodstuff and its influence on emergence and development of natural intestinal flora and the clinical status of premature very low birth weight neonates. The study was also intended to investigate reduction of colonisation by pathogenic bacteria and to estimate the incidence of gastrointestinal disorders.||Probotic bacteria contained in the investigational product administered directly after birth are beneficial for the development of normal gut microflora and can prevent or significantly limit gastrointestinal colonisation by pathogenic bacteria and the development of pathogenic flora in a hospital setting. Permanent colonisation with commensal flora in very early life improves gastrointestinal function in premature neonates by reducing the onset of or by decreasing the severity of the signs and symptoms of feeding intolerance and generalised bacterial infections, including sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis."

This clinical trial aims to evaluate the outcome of WMT combining with standard therapy for patients with 2019-novel coronavirus pneumonia, especially for those patients with dysbiosis-related conditions."
covid,"Thymalfasin (thymosin alpha 1 or Ta1), the active pharmaceutical ingredient in ZADAXIN® injection, is a 28-amino acid synthetic peptide, identical to natural Ta1 produced by the thymus gland. Ta1 is a biological response modifier which activates various cells of the immune system, and is therefore expected to have clinical benefits in disorders where immune responses are impaired or ineffective, including acute and chronic viral and bacterial infections, cancers, and vaccine non-responsiveness. Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on hemodialysis, in addition to their intrinsic kidney disease and frequent burden of comorbidities, also have increased risk of exposure to communicable diseases as they are treated several times each week at hemodialysis centers with several other patients and clinic staff in attendance. The majority of patients are over 60 years of age and many are receiving immunosuppressive medications. Accordingly, ESRD patients are particularly susceptible to COVID-19 infection. Ta1 has been shown to be safely administered to hemodialysis patients. It is our hypothesis that a course of Ta1 administered to individuals with ESRD will reduce the rate and severity of infection with COVID-19."

It is a member of the Corona virus family which is RNA enveloped viruses.||Very rapidly the virus emerged as pandemic. Now it is dominating the lives of every people of this universe. Management of the COVID-19 relies on mainly supportive care and oxygen supplementation via non-invasive or mechanical ventilation in critical cases. Patients who are critically ill may also require vasopressor support and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections.||There is no vaccine or highly effective antiviral drugs for COVID-19. Currently there is a tremendous effort around the world to develop effective preventive and therapeutic treatment for this disease.||World Health Organization has launched a non-blinded clinical trial (SOLIDARITY) to evaluate four candidate treatments (remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, lopinavir/ritonavir/ interferon beta-1a, and chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine) versus standard of care in 18 countries worldwide.

covid,"COVID-19's high mortality may be driven by hyperinflammation. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) axis therapies may reduce COVID-19 mortality. Retrospective analyses of tocilizumab in severe to critical COVID-19 patients have demonstrated survival advantage and lower likelihood of requiring invasive ventilation following tocilizumab administration. The majority of patients have rapid resolution (i.e., within 24-72 hours following administration) of both clinical and biochemical signs (fever and CRP, respectively) of hyperinflammation with only a single tocilizumab dose.||The investigators hypothesized that a dose of tocilizumab significantly lower than the EMA- and FDA-labeled dose (8mg/kg) as well as the emerging standard of care dose (400mg) may be effective in patients with COVID-19 pneumonitis and hyperinflammation.

Severe disease occurs in 15% of the cases with COVID-19 and may progress to critical disease in only 5% of the cases with a high risk of mortality. Critical disease may present as acute respiratory failure secondary to Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and is caused by the body's hyper-immune response to the virus in the form of a cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). There is currently no effective anti-viral treatment against SARS-CoV-2 and the mainstay of treatment is supportive.

The newly emerged Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan, China, has swept through 219 countries, killing a staggering number of people. According to WHO reports, the number of deaths had risen to 3,155,168by March 30, 2021, out of 149,910,744 confirmed cases. In Bangladesh, the outbreak has infected over 745,322confirmed cases, with over 11,053 deaths reported. Though the patient may be asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms, mortality is quite high in the severe form of the disease which often progresses to critical phase presented as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This is due to exaggerated response of immune system to the virus termed as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). There is currently no effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 and supportive care is the mainstay of therapy. As a result we are still searching for a better therapeutic agent which will help in treating Covid-19 cases in terms of mortality, morbidity, oxygen requirement, length of stay in hospital.

Official records indicate that, in Colombia, the first case was diagnosed on March 6, 2020, corresponding to a patient from Italy. However, in conversations with several infectologists and intensivists from Medellín, it was agreed that clinical cases similar to the clinical presentation that is now recognized as COVID-19 had arisen since the end of 2019 when it was still unknown to everyone. The previous suggests that the virus was already circulating in the country since before March 6, 2020. But at that moment, there were no tools to make a clinical identification, nor to diagnose it from the laboratory's point of view.||Considering as real the hypothesis that the infection has been circulating in the country since before the first official diagnosis, the question arises: Why does not the country still has the same healthcare and humanitarian chaos that countries such as Italy and Spain are suffering at this time? To answer this question may be that there are differences in vaccination rates with BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin or tuberculosis vaccine), which is significantly higher in Latin America compared to those in Europe. This finding could explain to some extent the situation in the country, since previous studies have shown the influence that this vaccine can have on the immune response against various other pathogens, including viruses.||Among the population at risk of infection, health-care workers due to their permanent contact with patients are the population group with the highest risk of contracting SARS-Cov-2 and developing COVID-19 in any of its clinical manifestations, and currently there are no vaccines or proven preventive interventions available to protect them.||For this reason, this research study aims to demonstrate whether the centennial vaccine against tuberculosis (BCG), a bacterial disease, can activate the human immune system in a broad way, allowing it to better combat the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 and, perhaps, prevents the complications that lead the patient to the intensive care unit and death.||In the future, and if these results are as expected, they may be the basis for undertaking a population vaccination campaign that improves clinical outcomes in the general population."
covid,"In December 2019, coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) was detected in many cases in Wuhan, China. With the rapid spread of the coronavirus, cases of COVID-19 were also reported in other cities of China and other countries. COVID-19 can cause amplification of the pulmonary inflammatory responses, including the production of a large amount of free radicals and the release of inflammatory factors, in a short time after infection, leading to lung tissue damage and dysfunction, even resulting in life-threatening respiratory distress syndrome and respiratory failure. At present, there are no effective drugs targeting COVID-19. Previous studies have shown that Buzhong Yiqi Decoction has anti-bacterial, anti-viral, and anti-allergy effects. High-dose vitamin C also has anti-oxidative and anti-toxin effects, possibly exhibiting good effects in the treatment of viral infection and critical respiratory diseases. The study objectives include (1) investigate whether Buzhong Yiqi Decoction can improve the clinical symptoms of patients with mild and severe COVID-19 and accelerate recovery and to further investigate the clinical efficacy of high-dose vitamin C combined with traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of mild and severe COVID-19; (2) to assess the safety of high-dose vitamin C combined with Chinese medicine in the treatment of mild and severe COVID-19."

covid,"Coronavirus 19 (COVID-19) is a viral respiratory disease that was identified in December 2019 after the first cases in China, spreading rapidly until reaching pandemic status, causing the collapse of numerous health systems and strong economic and social impact. By the end of April 2020, 3.08 million cases, and more than 214 thousand deaths were already recorded. The treatment so far has not been established and there are several clinical trials testing known drugs that have antiviral activity in vitro, due to the urgency that the global situation imposes. Medicines with specific actions can take years to be discovered, while a vaccine also takes a long time. Recently, it has been shown that the worsening of Coronavirus infection may be related to the formation of micro clots in blood vessels and anticoagulants have been used as adjuvants in the treatment. This study is justified by conducting a pilot study that showed an in vitro antiviral action (anti-COVID-19) of high molecular weight heparin. Methods: A phase I / II clinical trial will be conducted. 40 participants will be included in two arms. Participants allocated to Group 1 (control) will receive inhalation with 0.9% saline applied 4/4 hours, for 7 days. Participants allocated to Group 2 (intervention) will receive high molecular weight inhaled heparin (250ug / mL 0.9% SF), at a 4/4 hour dose, for 7 days. The outcomes of interest will be safety (absence of moderate or serious adverse events) and effectiveness (measured in a score of 7 points, with 1 absence of limitations and 7, death). Expected results: The development of a new therapeutic option for COVID-19 is expected, with the possibility of use in other serious coronavirus diseases, to be subsequently tested in phase III studies."

There is an urgent need for targeted and effective COVID-19 treatments which has put great pressure on researchers across the world for developing effective drugs. This paper reviews the possibility of using Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 Receptors -Like Enzyme of B38-CAP to treat SARS-CoV-2 based on the intracellular mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and consequences caused. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology, and it's being currently being investigated as a potential covid-19 and acute lung failure treatment through several clinical trials.. The SARS-CoV2 binding site was identified as ACE2, a part of the RAAS, which is known to protect the lung from injuries. it has been postulated that SARS-CoV-2 binding to ACE2 may attenuate residual ACE2 activity, skewing the ACE/ACE2 balance to a state of heightened angiotensin II activity leading to inflammatory and oxidative organ damage, as well as pulmonary vasoconstriction, which can lead to acute lung injury.. Therefore, treatment with recombinant soluble ACE2 protein and drugs that up regulate ACE2 may alleviate pulmonary complication. In animal models including heart failure, acute lung injury, and diabetic nephropathy, recombinant human ACE2 protein (rhACE2), which is devoid of its membrane-anchored domain thus soluble, has been shown to have beneficial effects. Despite its positive effects, rhACE2 is a glycosylated protein, which necessitates a time- and cost-intensive protein expression system using mammalian or insect cells, which may be inconvenient in drug production and medical economics. Moreover, we hypothesis that treating COVID-19 patients with recombinant soluble ACE2 protein may induce autoantibodies and T cells to cellular ACE2.Furthermore, rhACE2 may interact with spike protein based vaccine and worsen its effect . These autoantibodies may generated by enforced presentation of the soluble Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein in a complex with COVID-19 Spike protein in fragment crystallizable (FC) Receptor positive Antigen Presenting Cells in the blood The development of autoantibodies might make injury and damage to the host epithelial cells and hamper their ACE2 dependent function in lungs, intestine and testes which express ACE2. In addition to inducing platelet aggregation and thrombosis . Although it has been stated that immune response associated with the chronic infusion of rhACE2 resulting in the degradation of rhACE226, this was not the case with B38-CAP; no antibodies against B38-CAP were detected in the serum of mice infused with B38-CAP for two weeks... In this case we suggest that bacterial engineering could be used to develop better protein drugs for COVID-19 treatment... B38-CAP is an ACE2-like enzyme derived from bacteria that reduces hypertension and cardiac dysfunction. Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) plays a key role in cardiovascular physiology and pathology, and it is currently being studied in clinical trials to treat acute lung failure. In mice, B38-CAP treatment prevented angiotensin II-induced hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and fibrosis. B38-CAP is an ACE2-like enzyme derived from bacteria, demonstrating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase (B38-CAP) to a human ACE2-like enzyme. As a result, we think that treating COVID-19-infected patients with Bacterial ACE2 like enzymes, rather than human ACE2, may be preferable because it will perform the same role as human ACE2 and may not be recognized by COVID-19 spike protein||Keywords: COVID 2019 ,Infection, B38-CAP , Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme , rhACE226."

covid,"Combination of Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP and Isotretinoin could be promising treatment for COVID-19 infection- and Its inflammatory complications||Mahmoud ELkazzaz1||1Department of chemistry and biochemistry, Faculty of Science, Damietta University, Egypt.||_____________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________||B38-CAP is a bacteria-derived ACE2-like enzyme that suppresses hypertension and cardiac dysfunction Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is critically involved in cardiovascular physiology and pathology, and is currently clinically evaluated to treat acute lung failure. Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis, B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. A study demonstrated that the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved protein drugs for hypertension and heart failure. pretreatment of B38-CAP markedly down regulated a massive increase of plasma Ang II levels at 5 min after Ang II injection In addition to the currently used drugs to inhibit Ang II generation or signaling, such as ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers, direct down-modulation of Ang II levels by rhACE2 protein is one of the promising candidates for new therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular disease and other Ang II-related diseases, e.g. ARDS. On the other hand, although mass production of rhACE2 as a protein drug costs due to requirement of mammalian cell expression systems, B38-CAP is easily prepared with E. coli expression system and is cost effective. Therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity in mouse heart failure models would warrant further investigation of B38-CAP or other microbial carboxypeptidases in disease models. Finally the principal investigator expects that treatment with ACE2-like enzyme of bacteria B38-CAP expected to work efficiently Like human ACE2 and it will save the lung cells from COVID - 19 inhibitory effect and down regulation of ACE2 because COVID-19 binds to human ACE2 and down regulates it and this receptors is very important for lung cells survival and function So ,the principal investigator also expects that B38-CAP ACE2 like enzyme may be not recognized by COVID -19 spike protein because evolutionary it is too far away from human ace2 and human ACE2 is a real receptor of COVID -19 not ACE2 like enzyme but in the same time it will make the same function of human ACE2 In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P>0.1) Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening .

covid,"SARS-CoV-2 infection seems to induce in most critical cases an excessive and aberrant hyper-inflammatory host immune response that is associated with a so-called ""cytokine storm"", moreover pro-thrombotic derangements of haemostatic system is another common finding in most severe forms of COVID19 infections, which may be explained by the activation of coagulative cascade primed by inflammatory stimuli, in line with what is observed in many other forms of sepsis. Targeting inflammatory responses exploiting steroids' anti-inflammatory activity along with thrombosis prevention may be a promising therapeutic option to improve patients' outcome. Despite the biological plausibility, no good evidence is available on the efficacy and safety of heparin on sepsis patients, and many issues have to be addressed, regarding the proper timing, dosages and administration schedules of anticoagulant drugs. The primary objective is to assess the hypothesis that an adjunctive therapy with steroids and unfractionated heparin (UFH) or with steroids and low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are more effective in reducing any-cause mortality in critically-ill patients with pneumonia from COVID- 19 infection compared to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) alone. Mortality will be measured at 28 days. The study is designed as a multicenter, national, interventional, randomized, investigator sponsored, three arms study. Patients, who satisfy all inclusion criteria and no exclusion criteria, will be randomly assigned in a ratio 1:1:1 to one of the three treatment groups: LMWH group, LMWH+steroids or UFH+steroid group.

covid,"In recent months, a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, has been identified as the cause of a serious lung infection named COVID-19 by the World Health Organization. This virus has spread rapidly among the nations of the world and it is the cause of a pandemic and a global health emergency. There is still very little scientific evidence on the virus, however epidemiological data suggest that one of the most frequent comorbidities is diabetes, along with hypertension and heart disease. There is no scientific evidence on the possible effects of this infection on the function of the β cell and on glycemic control. Clinical evidence seems to suggest that COVID-19 infection mostly affects the respiratory system, and an acute worsening of glycemic compensation is not described as generally observed in bacterial pneumonia. However, previous work on acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) caused by similar coronaviruses, had described that the infection has multi-organ involvement related to the expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, in different organs, especially at the level of endocrine pancreatic tissue. In the population of this previous work, glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycaemia have been described and in 37 of 39 diabetic patients examined, a remission of diabetes was observed three years after the infection. It is possible that the coronaviruses responsible for SARS may enter the pancreatic islets using the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme receptor, expressed at the level of the endocrine pancreas, thus causing diabetes. Additionally, previous literature on coronavirus infections (SARS and MERS or Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome) suggested that diabetes could worsen the evolution of the disease. In particular, in case of Middle-East Respiratory Syndrome-CoV infection, diabetic mice had a more prolonged serious illness and a delay in recovery regardless of the viremic titer. This could probably be due to a dysregulation of the immune response, which results in more serious and prolonged lung disease.||There are currently no data on pancreatic beta cell function in patients with COVID-19."

The selection of this molecule is based on numerous experimental and clinical observations, which show its activity in modulating resistance to pathogens, in mitigating overall cardiovascular risk, and in acting on the production of Nitric Oxide (ON) in the lungs, which is emerging as a key therapeutic factor for the improvement of respiratory function in patients with SARS-COVID 19. Finally, OT is physiologically produced by the human body, especially in the female sex and in the age ranges that coincide with most resistant patients.

Although the response to 2 doses of 4CMenB is over 75% in other immunocompromised patients (Feavers, 2017), studies with 4CMenB are lacking after HSCT. Nevertheless, as serogroup B caused 74% of IMD in Europe between 2004-2014 (Whittaker, 2017), the meningococcal B vaccination is recommended by the more recent guidelines from 6 months after transplant. There are, however, no data on the safety and efficacy of this vaccine after hematopoietic stem cell allograft (HSCT).||The objective of this study is to assess the response to 2 doses of a multicomponent meningococcal B vaccine (4CMenB) given at 2 months interval in adult allogeneic HSCT recipients transplanted at least 6 months ago.||The response will be assessed 1 month and 10 months after the second dose of vaccine by measuring bactericidal antibodies against NadA, fHbp, NHBA and PorAP1 vaccinal antigens according to methods previously reported (Caron Lancet Infect Dis 2011).

meningococcal,"Meningitis or septicaemia (blood poisoning) caused by group B meningococcal infection (MenB) is an important cause of death and disability in the UK. Prevention through vaccination therefore remains a key public health priority. Research from national ""meningitis"" vaccine programmes against MenC, Hib and Streptococcus pneumoniae show us that their success is in part due to their ability to protect both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, so-called herd immunity. This protection probably occurs by reducing carriage of these meningitis bacteria in the back of the throat (mucosal immunity). How this happens is poorly understood but our research shows that naturally acquired immunity (transient contact between the immune system and the meningococcus in the back of the throat without causing disease) may impact on this process. We believe that to develop a MenB vaccine that is able to cause mucosal immunity and prevent MenB carriage, it is important to understand the interaction between natural immunity and vaccination. In this study we propose to administer MenB vaccine to adults in order to investigate this process. Our findings will provide important insights into Men B immunity, inform the design of novel vaccine strategies and allow the rational testing of new vaccines as they become available."

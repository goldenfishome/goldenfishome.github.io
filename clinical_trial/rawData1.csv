A 2004 literature calculated the diagnostic values of C-reactive protein (CRP) and procalcitonin (PCT) levels for the diagnosis of bacterial infections, relative to other causes of inflammation. For CRP, the sensitivity was 75% (95% CI: 62%-84%) and the specificity was 67% (95% CI: 56%-77%). For PCT, the sensitivity was 88% (95% CI: 62%-84%) and the specificity was 81% (95% CI: 67%-90%).||The first cellular immune response to infection consists of the mobilization of polynuclear neutrophils from the bone marrow to the infection site under the effect of pre-inflammatory cytokines, as well as the apoptosis of lymphocytes and their sequestration at the infection site. This results in lymphopenia and the elevated polynuclear neutrophil count (PNN) observed in bacterial infections.||Hence, it is legitimate to hypothesize that the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) can be used in the diagnosis of bacterial infection. This ratio's value in the diagnosis of sepsis in the emergency department was studied and the researchers found higher diagnostic values than for CRP and PCT.||The NLR's potential value in the diagnosis of a bacterial infection in a context of fever or hyperthermia (regardless of the presence or absence of bacteraemia) has not been studied before.

PCT was initially studied by Assicot1 for distinguishing between bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis. The CALC-I gene codes for PCT. In the absence of infection, the extrathyroid mRNA expression of the CALC-I gene is repressed, and expression is restricted to neuroendocrine thyroid and pulmonary cells. Infection induces the ubiquitous expression of the CALC-I gene. PCT is not transformed into calcitonin in parenchymatous tissues.

The use of new markers to improve the diagnosis of bacterial and viral infections is increasingly studied in adults. The diagnostic value of these new markers has been demonstrated by associating their dosage with that of CRP for example. This is the case for IP-10, TRAIL or MxA.

Current World Health Organization recommendations for the management of infants younger than 2 months of age who have serious bacterial infections involve hospitalization and parenteral therapy for at least 10 days with antibiotic regimens containing penicillin or ampicillin combined with an aminoglycoside.However, in many settings throughout the developing world, this is not currently possible, nor is this standard of care likely to be feasible in the near future. Several studies have reported that for a variety of sociocultural reasons many families are unable or unwilling to access hospital-based care and their sick young infants do not get hospitalized, and instead, receive a variety of home-based antibiotic therapies, or none at all. In our community field sites, approximately 70% of families refuse hospital referral for a sick newborn, despite provision of transport.||Thus, there is an urgent need to define the role of community/first-level facility-based care versus hospitalization for the management of young infants with serious bacterial infections, and the potential for community-based parenteral antibiotics as an alternative strategy in resource poor areas with high neonatal mortality rates.

Bacterial disease follows bacterial infection. Individuals can be infected without developing disease (carriage stage) but infection is needed to subsequently develop disease.

This specific antibiotic has several advantages for being deployable as a simple intervention in rural Africa, i.e. it requires a single oral administration, it has no special storage requirements and it has the potential to eliminate many of the bacteria commonly causing severe disease in newborn.||This clinical trial will be conducted in a peri-urban health facility in Western Gambia. If an impact is shown, the next step would be to conduct a larger study aiming at establishing if the intervention, implemented at a lower level of care (most African women deliver at home assisted by traditional birth assistants), decreases the occurrence of neonatal bacterial disease","Neonatal Infection","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","February 2013","August 2015","Azithromycin and Placebo","Drug","Phase 3","Female","45 Years","18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Gambia","Randomized","829",,

42,"Not yet recruiting","BACKGROUND: The spread of multidrug-resistant bacteria represents a well-known problem, which must be face up by optimizing antibiotic therapy both in terms of choosing the most appropriate drug and of an adequate treatment duration. The method of administration is also a critical element. There are data relating to the maximization of the efficacy of Carbapenems and Piperacillin/Tazobactam by continuous infusion, able to constantly maintain adequate drug concentrations. Several studies, conducted comparing a standard administration of Carbapenem or Piperacillin/Tazobactam to an extended administration or continuous perfusion to evaluate safety and efficacy in terms of mortality reduction, have been documented. The achievement of optimal serum concentrations during continuous infusion has been documented both for Carbapenems and Piperacillin/Tazobactam, and for other types of antibiotics such as Cefepime and Vancomycin. The duration of antibiotic treatment is a critical factor for the prevention of relapses as well as the onset of resistance. The recommended duration of antibiotic treatment varies according to the site of infection and the type of pathogen and is generally between 7 and 14 days, however, in particular cases it is possible that the administration of antibiotics must be longer than one month. In general, the length of hospitalization is associated with a greater likelihood of complications for patients, with a substantial increase in the risk of developing multiple types of complications, such nosocomial infections, bed rest, bedsores, falls, malnutrition and disorientation. It should also be noted that prolonged hospitalization leads to a substantial increase in care costs. The advantage in terms of greater therapeutic success linked to the continuous infusion of some types of antibiotics has been used for the development of home infusion protocols for antibiotic therapy. There are numerous studies that show the feasibility and effectiveness of home infusion antibiotic therapy using elastomeric devices, documenting its substantial equivalence with respect to hospital treatment. The antibiotics for which there is evidence of feasibility are various, including Cefepime, Vancomycin and Piperacillin/Tazobactam.||STUDY DESIGN: The study is aimed to patients with severe bacterial infections who have started an antibiotic treatment and are benefiting from such therapy. The purpose of the study is to move the continuation of antibiotic therapy to the home setting once its efficacy and tolerability during hospitalization have been documented, in order to allow the patient a potentially eradicating treatment, of adequate duration without the need of hospitalization. Patients are enrolled when the efficacy and tolerability of the ongoing antibiotic treatment based on Cefepime, Meropenem, Piperacillin/Tazobactam or Vancomycin has been documented. The protocol requires that the patient go to the hospital every morning to replace the elastomer and to carry out a medical examination. Blood chemistry tests, which include at least blood counts, electrolytes, renal function, liver function and inflammation indices are scheduled to be performed at least once a week. Exams can also be done more frequently based on clinical needs. Antibiotic therapy should be carried out until the infection is cured, as per current clinical practice. For the purposes of the study, the patient remains under observation for 30 days after enrollment. Blood samples for the assessment of antibiotic concentrations will be performed in correspondence with the blood chemistry tests performed routinely for patient assessment. In any case, for each patient, a sample is taken for the dosage of the antibiotic used, which will be a single sample in the event of a continuous infusion, or a downstream sample (within one hour of the new antibiotic administration) and peak (30 minutes after the end of the infusion). The pharmacokinetic sampling relating to the outpatient phase will be carried out on the third or fourth day of continuous infusion therapy at the time of the elastomer change.","Severe Bacterial Infections","No","Interventional","September 2021","December 2023","Cefepime|Piperacillin/tazobactam|Meropenem|Vancomycin","Drug|Drug|Drug|Drug","Phase 1","All","90 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Italy","Non-Randomized","50",,
43,"Completed","The delayed administration of an adequate antimicrobial therapy is a strong predictor of impaired outcome in patients with bacterial sepsis. Therefore, the current Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (2016) recommend that administration of intravenous antimicrobials be initiated within one hour following the recognition of sepsis or septic shock.||The quick Sepsis-related Organ Failure Assessment (qSOFA) score is a new bedside tool which has been recently proposed by the Third International Sepsis Consensus Definitions Task Force (Sepsis-3) to identify patients with suspected infection who are at greater risk for a poor outcome outside the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). It uses three criteria, assigning one point for low systolic blood pressure (SBP ≤100 mmHg), high respiratory rate (≥22 breaths per min) and altered mentation (Glasgow coma scale <15). The score ranges from 0 to 3 points. A qSOFA value ≥2 points is associated with a greater risk of death or prolonged ICU stay, these outcomes being more common in infected patients who may be septic than in those with uncomplicated infection. The definite goal of qSOFA is to hasten the management and thus improve the outcome of patients at risk of sepsis or septic shock.||Many patients admitted to the hospital for bacterial sepsis or septic shock are initially managed in the Emergency Department (ED). This study aims at investigating whether the routine calculation of qSOFA at patient triage may hasten the initiation of antimicrobial therapy in patients admitted to the ED with suspected or proven bacterial infection, especially in those with subsequent criteria for sepsis or septic shock (Sepsis-3 definition).","Bacterial Infection|Intensive Care","No","Interventional","October 12, 2017","June 10, 2018","systematic calculation of qSOFA","Procedure","Not Applicable","All","105 Years","18 Years","Diagnostic","Sequential Assignment","France","Non-Randomized","780",,

About 40% of patients treated with antibiotics are given superfluous treatment.||TREAT is a computerized decision support system for antibiotic treatment in inpatients with common bacterial infections. TREAT is based on a state of the art stochastic model of the domain (a causal probabilistic network) and uses a cost benefit model for antibiotic treatment, including costs assigned to future resistance.

51,"Completed","Some children get serious bacterial infections that require hospitalization and then a long course of antibiotics to completely treat the infection. Examples of these serious infections include ruptured appendicitis (when the appendix gets inflamed and bursts, releasing bacteria into the abdomen), complicated pneumonia (when an infected pocket of pus forms either in the lung or between the lung and chest wall), and osteomyelitis (an infection of the bone). To extend the duration of antibiotic therapy after discharge from the hospital, doctors will often insert a long catheter called a PICC line in the child's vein, which can stay in the body for several weeks. However, PICC lines require a fair amount of maintenance and training of caregivers in their use, require children to restrict their activities, and can lead to serious complications, such as blood stream infections and clots. An alternative to PICC lines is extending the duration of antibiotic therapy with oral antibiotics (pills or syrup) that achieve high levels of medicine in the blood and do not have the extra work, inconvenience and risks of PICC lines. Unfortunately, there are very few high quality studies that have demonstrated that oral antibiotics are just as good as intravenous antibiotics delivered via a PICC line, and so many doctors still recommend the PICC line treatment option. Also, no studies have been done to compare the impact of these two treatment options on the quality of life of the child and their caregivers.||In this proposal the investigator outline a series of projects to compare oral antibiotics vs. intravenous antibiotics delivered via a PICC line in children who require prolonged (at least 1 week) home antibiotic therapy after hospitalization for three different serious bacterial infections: ruptured appendicitis, complicated pneumonia, and osteomyelitis. To see whether oral antibiotics are just as good as PICC lines, the investigators will use data collected from over 15,000 children with one of these three infections who were hospitalized at one of 43 US children's hospitals during the years 2009-2011, and determine whether PICC lines resulted in fewer rehospitalizations for treatment failure than oral therapy.","Osteomyelitis|Pneumonia|Appendicitis","No","Observational","January 2009",,"Peripherally Inserted Central Catheter (PICC)","Device",,"All","17 Years","2 Months",,,,,"15000",,

Zinc is a crucial micronutrient as it influences various immune mechanisms and modulates host resistance to several pathogens. It has shown benefits as an adjunct therapy in infections like diarrhea and pneumonia in older children Given the predisposition of young infants in developing countries to zinc deficiency and infections, addition of zinc to standard treatment of serious bacterial infections may lead to significant improvements in the outcomes.||Several hypotheses will be examined in this clinical trial. The primary objective is to measure, in a double blind randomized controlled trial, the efficacy of giving 2 RDA (Required Daily Allowance 10 mg) of zinc orally in addition to routine antibiotics, for treatment of possible serious bacterial infection in infants >= 7 days and up to 4 months of age in reducing the proportion of treatment failures and time to discharge from the hospital. This will evaluate the clinical consequences of the possible immunomodulation by zinc supplementation. This is critical to demonstrate because nearly 80% of infant mortality occurs in first months of life.||Young infants with possible serious bacterial infections fulfilling the inclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study and stratified into 4 groups on basis of weight for age 'z' scores < -2 z and >=- 2 z and whether he/she has diarrhea or not.

103,"Completed","Postoperative complications, especially bacterial infections, are relatively common and cause increased morbidity and mortality. Effective and timely antimicrobial treatment is important for prognosis, and delayed diagnosis and treatment substantially increase mortality. The early diagnosis of infection and sepsis are today based on diagnostic tests that have been available for years, like WBC count, SR and CRP. These markers suffer from several drawbacks; their sensitivity and specificity for infection and sepsis are not good enough and their kinetics are rather slow in terms of both increase and decrease. A major disadvantage of CRP is that after surgery and trauma this marker generally increases for several days, reaching a plateau typically on day 2-4 following the event, and therefore, in most cases do not offer the needed guidance for early treatment of bacterial infection. More recently, other biomarkers for infection and sepsis have become available, some of which appear acceptable for diagnostic use. Procalcitonin (PCT) and neutrophil CD64 are both promising new markers for the early detection of infection. They do both have their pros and cons compared to each other and compared to the traditional markers, such as CRP and WBC count. It is a general view that further research is needed before these markers will be accepted as part of the routine protocol for the diagnosis of infections, especially in relation to postoperative complications. The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical utility of procalcitonin (PCT) and neutrophil CD64 as markers for infection and inflammation:||to evaluate if it is possible to detect early phase postoperative infections by using these tests versus traditional markers such as CRP, SR and WBC count (with differential).|to differentiate between systemic bacterial infection and systemic inflammation due to the surgical trauma.||The hypothesis is that PCT and neutrophil CD64 are more sensitive and specific analysis for the early detection of infection after abdominal surgery than CRP (and other widely used tests for inflammation and infection), and that neutrophil CD64 is more specific than PCT. Patients admitted to the Department of Gastroenterological Surgery, Akershus University Hospital for elective abdominal surgery will be included in the study after informed consent. Initially consecutive series of 150 patients will be included, but this number may be increased depending on the number of observed infections during the course of the study. All patients will be monitored and treated by the formal protocol related to clinical signs of infection, such as abcess, peritonitis, pneumonia, sepsis and septic shock. In addition to the analytical parameters routinely used today in order to discover infections (CRP, WBC count etc), blood samples for PCT and neutrophil CD64 will be analyzed before surgery and daily during the stay at the hospital.

112,"Unknown status","Sepsis is a common cause of morbidity and death in intensive care units. Clinical and laboratory signs of systemic inflammation, including changes in body temperature, tachycardia, or leukocytosis, are neither sensitive nor specific enough for the diagnosis of sepsis. The diagnosis of sepsis is difficult, because clinical signs are unspecific. These signs include tachycardia, leucocytosis, tachypnoea, and pyrexia, which are collectively termed a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). SIRS is very common in critically ill patients, being found in various conditions including trauma, surgery, burns, pancreatitis, post-cardiac arrest syndrome, cardiac surgery. Microbiological culture can be used to distinguish sepsis from non-infectious conditions. However, this method lacks sensitivity and specificity, and there is often a substantial time delay. So these signs can also be misleading because critically ill patients often present with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome without infection. This issue is of paramount importance, since therapy and outcome differ greatly between patients with and those without sepsis; clinicians are often prone to overuse antibiotic therapy being afraid of not treating a potential infection or superinfection. Moreover, the widespread use of antibiotics for all such patients is likely to increase antibiotic resistance, toxicity, and costs. On the opposite, any delay in administration of antibiotics can be extremely detrimental for the infected patient with an exponential increase of the odd ratio for death. Search for early biomarker tools for the diagnosis of infection, initially promising, are quite challenged and controversial nowadays because they can be more related to the inflammation response, irrespective to the insult. Furthermore up to 40% of the infections remain strongly suspected but not bacteriologically documented. Persisting researches are ongoing to find new markers to better discriminate SIRS related to infection process from to SIRS not related to infection. Cytokine profiles using multiplex analysis seems more related to the severity of the SIRS than the trigger of the SIRS (infectious or non infectious diseases). Thus, new tools have been developed to identify bacteria by detecting their DNA by various techniques. These techniques have many potential interests over conventional microbiologic tests by decreasing turnaround time (within a few hours 2-6 hours), reducing inhibitory effects of prior use of antibiotics, detection of slow or fastidious growing organisms. However these tests remain to be validated in a clinical setting.||The goal of the current study is to evaluate the diagnostic value of plasma detection of bacterial DNA in ICU patients with a clinical suspicion of bacterial infection.","Infection|Sepsis","No","Observational","September 2008","November 2010","Observational study","Other",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"France|France|France|France|France",,"400",,

These bacteremia have significant consequences in terms of morbidity and mortality (ref. 1,2,3). They can lead to a state of septic shock that is life-threatening for the patient and must be treated as a matter of urgency. Any delay in treatment is detrimental to the patient. Management is based on prescription of probabilistic antibiotic therapy as soon as bacteremia is suspected.||At the Groupe Hospitalier Paris Saint Joseph (GHPSJ), as soon as a blood culture is known to be positive, the Mobile Clinical Microbiology Unit (UMMC) is notified in real time. The UMMC infectiologist, in consultation with the microbiologist, evaluates microbiological data and compares them with clinical data in order to prescribe probabilistic antibiotic therapy in the patient's bed. The possible adaptation of antibiotic treatment then depends on the results of antibiotic susceptibility test.||Early adaptation of antibiotic treatment to antibiotic susceptibility data, to reassess ineffective treatment or to reduce antibiotic therapy spectrum, significantly improves patient prognosis: it is therefore important that the laboratory makes antibiotic susceptibility test results available to the clinician as early as possible.","Bacterial Infections","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","April 1, 2019","October 30, 2019",,,,"All",,"18 Years",,,"France",,"330",,

184,"Recruiting","Clinical pneumonia is a leading cause of pediatric hospitalization. The etiology is generally bacterial or viral. Prompt and optimal treatment of pneumonia is critical to reduce mortality. However, adequate pneumonia management is hampered by: a) the lack of a diagnostic tool that can be used at point-of-care (POC) and promptly and accurately allow the diagnosis of bacterial disease and b) lack of a prognostic POC test to help triage children in need of intensive assistance. Antibiotic therapy is frequently overprescribed as a result of suspected bacterial infections resulting in development of antibiotic resistance. Conversely, in malaria-endemic areas, antibiotics may also be ""underprescribed"" and children with bacterial pneumonia sent home without antibiotic therapy, when the clinical pneumonia is mistakenly attributed to a co-existing malaria infection.||The investigators previously identified combinations of protein with 96% sensitivity and 86% specificity for detecting bacterial disease in Mozambican children with clinical pneumonia. The investigators' prior work showed that it is possible to identify biosignatures for diagnosis and prognosis using few proteins. Recently, other authors also identified different accurate biosignatures (e.g., IP-10, TRAIL and CRP).||In this study, the investigators propose to validate and improve upon previous biosignatures by testing prior combinations and seeking novel combinations of markers in 900 pediatric inpatients aged 2 months to 5 years with clinical pneumonia in The Gambia. The investigators will also use alternative case criteria and seek diagnostic and prognostic combination of markers. This study will be conducted in Basse, rural Gambia, in two hospitals associated with the Medical Research Council Unity The Gambia (MRCG). Approximately 900 pediatric patients with clinical pneumonia aged 2 months to 5 years of age will be enrolled.

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is the most frequent infection and induces severe circulatory dysfunction associated with renal failure in about 30% of cases. Renal failure is a reliable surrogate marker of in-hospital mortality in patients with SBP or with non-SBP infections. Albumin, as an adjuvant to antibiotherapy reduces significantly the rate of renal failure, in-hospital mortality, and overall mortality (Sort P, et al. NEJM 1999). However, little is known regarding the effect of albumin administration in patients with non-SBP infections. Two recent prospective studies demonstrated that non-SBP infections are associated with impairment of the effective circulating volume and precipitate renal failure whatever the presence of ascites.||The aim of this randomized clinical trial is to evaluate the effects of albumin, associated with appropriate antibiotic therapy, on occurrence or deterioration of renal failure and survival in septic (SIRS criteria required) cirrhotic patients with non-SBP infections and presenting with a Child-Pugh score > 8.","Cirrhosis|Sepsis|Renal Failure","No","Interventional","December 2008","June 2012","Human Albumin","Drug","Phase 3","All","80 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France","Randomized","193",,

However, the clinical outcome of cirrhotic patients with serious infections is significantly improved over the last 30 years due to early diagnosis and to the use of a more appropriate antibiotic therapy.||As in the general population, empirical treatment should be initiated soon after diagnosis, after making the necessary sampling and should be based on the use of an antibiotic with low toxicity and broad spectrum antibacterial efficacy, taking into account the local epidemiology and prevalence of antibiotic resistance.||The third generation cephalosporins are considered the gold standard in the treatment of most infections in cirrhotics due to their effectiveness against enterobacteriaceae and against non-enterococcal streptococci and due to their low toxicity.||However, the recommendations for the antibiotic therapy are currently based on results of trials of '80s and '90s, when the proportion of resistant pathogens was lower. Similarly to nosocomial infections, the increasing rate of infections due to multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria represents the rational for a different choice of empirical antibiotic therapy with a higher resistance barrier. This change in the epidemiology of community acquired infections is mainly due to the increased contacts with healthcare system of these patients and for the larger use of antibiotic prophylaxis. With this regard, it was recently proposed to introduce a third epidemiological class of infection ""Health care-associated"": Infections occurring in community in patients who have been in contact with the health system shortly before the infection.||This epidemiological class of infection should be distinguished from ""community-acquired"" because they are more similar to""nosocomial"" in terms of their sensitivity to antibiotics.

Investigators would like to study if the antibiotic concentrations during a dose of this antibiotic reaches the right concentrations necessary to kill the bacteria that is causing the infection. The process by which a drug travels through the body in blood, how it is broken down and removed by the body is called pharmacokinetics (PK).

This information about how the antibiotic is processed in the critically ill patient is unknown and it is important to know whether the doses doctors give patients to fight infection are adequate.

230,"Completed","Triple therapy (TT) comprising proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin 1g and clarithromycin 500mg twice daily has long been considered one of the standard treatment for H. pylori infection as initial studies demonstrated success rates of > 90% on per protocol analysis (PP) and > 80% on intention to treat (ITT) analysis. However increasing bacterial resistance, especially to clarithromycin, has been reported and there are concerns that the efficacy of TT has decreased. Sequential therapy (ST) is an alternative first line therapy that consists of 5 days of treatment with a PPI and amoxicillin followed by 5-day treatment with the PPI and clarithromycin and metronidazole. The rationale for this approach is that amoxicillin may weaken the bacterial cell wall in the initial phase of treatment, and prevent the development of drug efflux channels that inhibit clarithromycin from binding to ribosomes and thus help to improve the efficacy of clarithromycin in the second phase of treatment. A recent meta-analysis based on mainly European studies showed that the success rate of ST compared to TT was 92.8 - 96% vs. 76.2 - 78.8%. Concomitant therapy (CT) is another alternative first line treatment that consists of 10 days of PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and metronidazole. The rationale for using CT as a first line treatment option is to address the possibility of clarithromycin resistance which is increasingly encountered in clinical practice. Currently there are no randomized controlled studies that compared TT with ST in Singapore, although both regimens are being used in routine clinical practice. The hypothesis is that ST is superior to TT as first line treatment for H. pylori infection.||The study aim to compare 10-day TT versus 10-day ST versus 10-day CT as first line treatment for H. pylori infection in Singapore.","Bacterial Infection Due to Helicobacter Pylori (H.

251,"Completed","Escalating resistance to antibiotics among disease-causing community bacteria increasingly threatens our ability to treat patients' infections. At the level of the physician-patient encounter, incentives at the patient level often take priority to society; this is often the case with antibiotic prescribing. Each patient level antibiotic treatment decision is based on how we value potential outcomes, including short-term benefits and risks and longer-term risks, including those related to future bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Unfortunately, antibiotics are often prescribed for illnesses unlikely to have a bacterial etiology; even a very small likelihood of benefit seems to outweigh an increased risk of future antibiotic resistance. While short-term effects of antibiotics on colonization with resistant bacteria have been demonstrated, the overall implications of each treatment for future individual, family and societal-level resistance remain difficult to quantify, and are often steeply discounted or ignored during decision-making. Knowledge regarding the longer-term effects of personal and household antibiotic use could better quantify these future resistance-related risks, and help guide antibiotic decision-making for physicians and patients.||Infants are born with sterile nasopharyngeal and gastrointestinal tracts and yet, during the 1st year of life, become important reservoirs of resistant organisms; this creates an opportunity to study colonization and resistance starting from a microbiological tabula rasa. In this proposal, we will use an observational cohort to following newborns' antibiotic exposure and longitudinal colonization with specific bacterial pathogens and related antibiotic resistance in the 1st year of life. Our hypothesis is that during the 1st year of life, infants with personal and household antibiotic exposure will have greater colonization with resistan organisms than infants without antibiotic exposure.

263,"Recruiting","Burns are one of the common forms of trauma and are a cause of unintentional death and injury. Management of burns becomes complex due to multiple associated complications, for instance, secondary infection of burn wounds is the most common complication associated with burn injuries. Treatment of bacterial infections with antibiotics is becoming more challenging due to the development of multidrug-resistance. Hence, there is a critical need to investigate and establish non-antibiotic approaches to prevent colonization, control growth, and eliminate bacteria from burn wounds. Recent studies have explored the beneficial effects of open-to-air strategies on wound healing. Based on the evidence, the investigators hypothesize that bacterial load in burn wounds will be lowered when treated with an open-to-air strategy compared to the traditional closed wound approach.","Burns|Infection Wound|Bacterial Infections","No","Interventional","November 1, 2020","March 31, 2022","Open-to-air strategy|Traditional closed-wound management","Procedure|Procedure","Not Applicable","All","89 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","United States","Randomized","20",,

Closed suction drains are also used routinely in immediate breast reconstruction to prevent fluid accumulation and seroma formation at the surgical sites. Antibiotics are most often prescribed as a precaution since drains can be a source for infection by creating open channels to outside contaminants. Plastic surgery patients without closed suction drainage devices are usually not placed on prolonged postoperative antibiotics. Current preoperative surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is recommended for up to 24 hours only. These recommendations do not take into account the increased risk of indwelling closed suction drains.

The bacteria that normally reside in the intestine play a critical role in its development. Injury to the lining of the bowel that results from the high dose chemotherapy or radiation that transplant patients receive during the week preceding the transplant allows the bacteria to invade the intestines and spread to nearby lymph nodes. This, in turn, causes inflammation which has been shown to promote GVHD.

382,"Completed","Exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are the first cause of admission to Pulmonary Department in Italy and worldwide. Guidelines recommend treating most patients hospitalized for exacerbations of COPD with antibiotics, even if the role of bacterial infection is often uncertain and the effect of antibiotics poor. The recommendation to use antibiotics is guided by clinical signs and symptoms that have an insufficient diagnostic accuracy, whereas serum biomarkers as procalcitonin (PRO-CT) may guide the selection of COPD patients who need antibiotic treatment. The main aim of the study is to investigate whether antibiotics can be safely stopped after 3 days or continued for 10 days according to a PRO-CT-guided algorithm in patients hospitalized for exacerbations of COPD for whom guidelines recommend 3-10 days antibiotic treatment based on presence of increased dyspnoea, sputum and purulence. The study is designed to assess the non inferiority of the PRO-CT guided plan as compared to the standard guideline recommended plan. The PRO-CT guided withholding of antibiotics is viewed as an experimental intervention associated with less antibiotic-associated complications, eg antibiotic resistance and drug-related side-effect and lower costs. The proposed study is a prospective, randomised controlled, single-blinded intervention trial comparing the standard with a PRO-CT guided antibiotic treatment plan. Patients will be recruited from the Pulmonary Department of 18 University or City Hospitals in Italy, starting October 2006 and continuing until December 2010. Results expected by end of 2011. The 100 patients randomised to the standard non PRO-CT guided antibiotic treatment plan will continue antibiotics for 10 days, whereas the 100 patients randomised to the PRO-CT guided antibiotic treatment plan will continue for 10 days or stop antibiotics on day 3 depending on PRO-CT levels measured at admission, day 1 and day 2. Serum PRO-CT will be measured in a central laboratory. Patients will be examined at admission, discharge, 10 days, 1, 3 and 6 months. A telephone interview will be obtained at 2, 4 and 5 months. The primary outcome of the study will be the rate of exacerbations. Secondary outcomes will be hospital readmission, admission to ICU, change in FEV1, duration of hospitalization, and death.

In western countries, ASA has overtaken non steroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) as a major cause of peptic ulcer bleeding in the elderly population [1,2]. Management of peptic ulcer bleeding in patients receiving ASA for cardiothrombotic diseases is a clinical dilemma. In a randomized trial of continuous versus interrupted ASA therapy after endoscopic treatment of peptic ulcer bleeding, patients who discontinued ASA had a 10-fold increased incidence of all-cause mortality compared to those who received continuous ASA therapy. On the other hand, patients receiving continuous ASA therapy had a two-fold increased risk of early rebleeding [3]. Thus, preventing the occurrence of peptic ulcer bleeding in ASA users is important in reducing morbidity and mortality.||Given the uncertain clinical utility of Helicobacter Pylori (Hp) testing in ASA users, this prospective cohort study aims to determine whether testing for Hp will have any impact on the long-term incidence of ulcer bleeding in ASA users with high ulcer risk.

It has been well-established that bacterial colonization is prevalent in COPD, especially in moderate to severe COPD, and airway bacterial colonization is known to play an important role in the development of pneumonia and exacerbations. On the other way, inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) and long acting β2 agonist (LABA) were recommended in the treatment of moderate to severe COPD. Though there were some evidences that ICS had some protective effects on airway mucosa against bacteria invasion, the locally immunosuppressive effects of ICS is still a concern. Indeed, the incidence of pneumonia was higher than the control group, not only in the Towards a Revolution in COPD Health (TORCH) study but also in various studies and meta-analyses.We hypothesized that airway bacteria colonization is associated with disease severity, and that disease status can be identified by CAT (COPD assessment test)scores and changes of CAT scores. We therefore conducted this prospective, observational study in which CAT scores and sputum cultures were assessed in moderate to severe COPD patients with the combination therapy of ICS and LABA every three months during the study period. The primary end-point is the condition of potential pathogenic microorganisms (PPM) colonization in view of CAT scores. The second end-point was the changes of PPM colonization in association with CAT changes during follow-up.

405,"Completed","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth most common cause of death and the only one of the common causes that is still rising. The main effects of the disease are the destruction and inflammation of lung tissue rendering breathing difficult. COPD has significant effects on the quality of life of sufferers and the disease is predicted to be the fifth most common cause of disability in the world by 2020. Patients with COPD are prone to periods of worsening disease symptoms, known as exacerbations, which are often caused by viral and bacterial infections of the lung and current vaccines appear to have little efficacy in limiting these exacerbations. The loss of lung function caused by infectious exacerbations is irreversible and patients who frequently exacerbate experience more rapid disease progression. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major bacterial species that colonises the airways and causes exacerbations in COPD. With the development of more sensitive molecular techniques it has been possible to ascertain that it is the acquisition of new strains of NTHi that correlate strongly with exacerbations. However, not all patients with COPD have NTHi in their lungs and the question remains as to why some COPD patients are susceptible to such infections. This study aims to answer this question by comparing the airways of COPD patients who are colonized by NTHi and those who are not to analyse whether the levels of protective antibodies in the lungs and the function of the immune cells in the NTHi colonized airway are reduced. Moreover, we aim to correlate this reduction in immunity with areas of lung damage ascertained by high resolution computed tomography. The aim of this research is to better understand this apparent deficiency in airway immunity as this is likely to impact on vaccine efficacy in COPD.","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD)","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","September 2012","December 2015",,,,"All","85 Years","40 Years",,,"United Kingdom",,"57",,

Sunscreens might protect the skin from the reaction. Although phototoxicity from voriconazole is not completely understood, it may be related to how that medication is metabolized in the liver by enzymes called cytochrome P450 enzymes-and mainly by one known as 2C19. A way to evaluate phototoxicity is through microarrays, which measure how much each gene is expressed in cells from tissues such as skin.||Patients ages 8 and older who are scheduled to begin taking or who currently take voriconazole may be eligible for this study. Also, patients ages 18 to 45 in good health who have skin tone known as Type 2, which usually burns and tans only slightly following sun exposure, may be eligible. All patients will visit the Dermatology Clinic. They will complete two questionnaires, on medical history and medications, as well as the skin response to sunlight, and donate about 3 teaspoons of blood. Patients who are scheduled to take voriconazole will visit the clinic four times, that is, two visits 2 consecutive days before beginning the medication and two visits on 2 consecutive days after taking it for at least 7 days. Each visit will take 1 to 2 hours. Patients about to take voriconazole will have a blood test and undergo a physical exam of the skin test site, on the buttocks. Researchers will take photographs of the specific site and do tests to measure skin reaction to ultraviolet (UV) light. UV light will be shined on 15 small areas of the skin, each 1 x 1 centimeters. After 24 hours, any redness that occurs on the skin will be checked. Afterward, patients will begin taking voriconazole according to directions by the researchers. At 10 or more days later, patients will visit the clinic. Sunscreen will be applied and 1 hour later after administration of voriconazole, a blood sample will be drawn to check the level of medication. Then UV light will be shined on 23 areas of skin 1 x 1 centimeters. More photographs will be taken of test sites to record changes in skin redness. On the next day, the skin response will be evaluated. Participants in the control group will be asked to avoid UV radiation by wearing hats and clothing, and using sunscreen. They will be given the doxycycline, an antibiotic, and undergo procedures with UV light shined on small areas of the skin, on the buttocks. Control participants will have 7 study days, with visits lasting from 1 to 3 hours and probably not exceeding 8 hours. They will have two shave biopsies on Study Day 2 and on Study Day 7 to determine how the skin has responded to UV light exposures.","Healthy Volunteers|Fungal Infections|Bacterial Infections","No","Interventional","May 25, 2007","September 20, 2011","Doxycycline|Voriconazole","Drug|Drug","Phase 1","All","100 Years","8 Years","Basic Science","Parallel Assignment","United States","Non-Randomized","62",,

Treatment with antiviral therapy may be effective in changing the course of disease and decreasing mortality in this vulnerable population. AZT treatment has been shown to decrease mortality and the frequency of opportunistic infections in certain adult AIDS patients; therefore, it is likely that children may also benefit from this antiviral therapy. In addition, bacterial infections are frequently found in HIV-infected children. Because pooled human serum immunoglobulin, another name for antibodies, is effective in reducing bacterial infection in patients with defects of immunity, it may reduce the rate of bacterial infection in HIV-infected children as well.

Heparin, a widely used anticoagulant medicine to prevent or treat thrombotic disorders, has been demonstrated to prevent organ damage and lethality in experimental sepsis models. However, the efficacy of heparin in the treatment of clinical sepsis is not consistent. Caspase-11, a cytosolic receptor of LPS, triggers lethal immune responses in sepsis. Recently, we have revealed that heparin prevents cytosolic delivery of LPS and caspase-11 activation in sepsis through inhibiting the heparanase-mediated glycocalyx degradation and the HMGB1- LPS interaction, which is independent of its anticoagulant properties. In our study, it is found that heparin treatment could prevent lethal responses in endotoxemia or Gram-negative sepsis, while caspase-11 deficiency or heparin treatment failed to confer protection against sepsis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, a type of Gram-positive bacterium. It is probably that other pathogens such as Gram-positive bacteria might cause death through mechanisms distinct from that of Gram-negative bacteria. Peptidoglycan, a cell-wall component of Gram-positive bacteria, can cause DIC and impair survival in primates by activating both extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways, which might not be targeted by heparin. We speculate that the discrepancy between the previous clinical trials of heparin might be due to the difference in infected pathogens. Thus, stratification of patients based on the type of invading pathogens might improve the therapeutic efficiency of heparin in sepsis, and this merits future investigations.","Sepsis|Gram-Negative Bacterial Infections|Heparin","No","Interventional","April 20, 2021","July 30, 2023","Unfractionated Heparin","Drug","Phase 3","All","75 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","China","Randomized","100",,

The in-hospital and three-month mortality rates, furthermore, were significantly lower in the group treated with albumin.||It is not known if other bacterial infections unrelated to SBP represent a risk factor for the development of renal failure among cirrhotic patients. The researcher's group has recently performed a study to evaluate the incidence, characteristics and outcome, of renal failure in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infections unrelated to SBP associated with the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (Terra, unpublished results). Among a total of 106 patients, 29 (27%) presented renal failure during the course of infection. Renal failure was characterized by intense renal vasoconstriction (intrarenal resistive index of 0.83 +/- 0.09, measured by Doppler ultrasound), reduction of mean arterial pressure and an important activation of endogenous vasoconstriction systems. The three-month survival probability of patients with infection and renal failure was 34 %, much lower than that of patients with infection but not presenting renal failure (87%, p<0.0001). These results suggest that the development of renal failure in patients with cirrhosis and bacterial infections different from SBP, associated with signs of a systemic inflammatory response, is very frequent and results in a very poor prognosis.

Several strategies have been proposed to overcome the declining eradication rate, including (1) extending the treatment duration of triple therapy to 14 days; (2) the use of bismuth quadruple therapy which contains bismuth, a proton pump inhibitor, and two antibiotics (usually metronidazole and tetracycline); (3) non-bismuth quadruple therapy (concomitant therapy) which contains a proton pump inhibitor and three antibiotics (usually amoxicillin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin); (4) sequential therapy which contains a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus amoxicillin for five days, followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin and tinidazole for another five days.

The eradication of H. pylori can reduce the recurrence rate of peptic ulcer disease and even has the potential to prevent gastric cancer. H. pylori is the most common chronic bacterial infection in humans. The prevalence of H. pylori is about 30-50% in the Western adult population.

Quinolone antibiotics are often used because of their distribution in the body, of the great number of bacterial species that are sensitive to these antibiotics and the possibility to give oral treatments.||For a long time no transferable resistance gene to quinolones from one bacterium to another had been observed. This phenomenon has been demonstrated in 1998 in a bacterium of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species carrying a qnrA gene which encodes a protein that protects the target of the antibiotic in the bacteria. Since several genes have been observed. These genes reduce the sensitivity of the bacteria without ever reach detectable resistance levels on the tests commonly used in the laboratory. However, these genes are often found among enterobacteria in combination with other mechanisms of resistance to other classes of antibiotics including beta-lactam antibiotics that are widely used antibiotics.||Moreover, it is considered that quinolone administration to bacteria carrying these qnr genes could promote the emergence of mutants resistant to quinolones to a more high-level. That furthers multiresistance emergence when the bacteria is already resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics.||The aim of this study performed between April 2008 and March 2009 was to collect strains resistant to beta-lactams because of the production of enzymes, called extended-spectrum beta-lactamase to determine quinolone resistance gene frequency in these bacteria.||Meanwhile, control patients were selected to seek the emergence of these genes risk factors.||The clinical study failed to identify specific risk factors, however, the biological study enhanced the knowledge on this issue with the setting-up of a method for rapid detection of these plasmidic mediated quinolones resistance genes and the description a new plasmid containing a qnr gene, qnrD, whose study is still ongoing.","Enterobacteriaceae Infection","No","Observational","January 2009","October 2009","collection of bacterial sample","Other",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"France",,"133",,

However, in a pilot study in Myanmar (High Frequency of Clinically Significant Bacteremia in Adults Hospitalized With Falciparum Malaria PMID: 26989752) we found that 13% of adults hospitalized with falciparum malaria were bacteremic, with bacterial co-infection suspected by clinicians in the minority. Patients with serious bacterial infection are commonly not bacteraemic and so this probably underestimates the frequency of significant bacterial co-infection.||In that pilot study, over 75% of patients received empirical antibacterial therapy on admission to hospital, which would not accord with published WHO guidelines as clinicians suspected bacterial co-infection in only 17%. However, the study's 100% survival rate - when over half of the patients were at high risk of death - suggests that the administration of antibacterial therapy may be appropriate until bacterial co-infection is excluded.||There is also academic debate about the role of co-morbidities in the presentation of patients severely ill with vivax malaria. Bacterial co-infection has been reported in some - but by no means all - studies of severe vivax infection. It would be useful to determine the relative contribution of bacterial co-infection to the clinical presentation of patients with vivax malaria.||By systematically seeking evidence of bacterial co-infection in all patients hospitalized at the study sites, this study aims to determine if the bacterial infection is really as prevalent as was the case in the pilot study. Accordingly it aims to determine the utility of a strategy that includes empirical antibacterial therapy in adults hospitalized with malaria in low transmission settings, until significant bactrila infection has been excluded.","Malaria|Bacteremia|Sepsis","No","Observational","May 1, 2016","January 1, 2018",,,,"All",,"16 Years",,,"Myanmar",,"20",,

Conventionally, detection of expression of ESBLs was based on reduction of ceftazidime of cefotaxime MICs by ≥ 3 two fold dilutions in the presence of clavulanic acid. However, the use of the above method was limited to cover only some of the bacterial species, including predominantly E. coli and Klebsiella spp., or tested strains which were all transconjugants generated in vitro.

Cells and secretions from the airways are rinsed with salt water (bronchoalveolar lavage) and a flexible brush the size of a pencil tip is passed through the bronchoscope to scrape cells lining the airways. Lastly, pieces of tissue (the size of the ball of a ballpoint pen) lining the airways are removed for examination under the microscope.||Intravenous Endotoxin: A small dose of endotoxin is injected into a vein. Blood samples are drawn at regular intervals for 8 hours after the injection and again after 1, 2, 3, 7 and 14 days to analyze the body s immune response to the bacteria in the blood.||Instilled Endotoxin in the Lungs: A small amount (2 teaspoons) of salt water is squirted through a bronchoscope into a lobe of one lung, and then salt water containing a small dose of endotoxin is squirted into the other lung. Bronchial lavage, brushing, and biopsy (see above) are then done to study the response of the lung to the endotoxin.

COPD patients are more susceptible to bacterial infections and both chronic and acute infections are common. COPD patients with chronic lung bacterial infection have worse quality of life, faster disease progression, more symptoms and frequent exacerbations. Acute infections are the main cause of COPD exacerbations which cause COPD patients to become acutely unwell and often result in hospitalisation especially in the winter. Antibiotics are frequently used to treat COPD exacerbations and this contributes to the development of antibiotic resistance. Therefore there is a need to develop antibiotic-independent approaches to reducing or preventing bacterial infection in COPD.||The investigators have carried out work in in animal studies and in humans showing that there is a link between high levels of glucose in the lung and bacterial lung infection. Levels of glucose in the lung are higher in COPD patients compared with people without COPD. These higher glucose levels support greater bacterial growth probably because glucose is a nutrient for bacteria. Therefore reducing airway glucose has the potential to inhibit bacterial growth in COPD patients.||In animal studies the investigators have demonstrated that the diabetic drug metformin decreases airway glucose and bacterial growth. The investigators wish to determine if metformin can achieve the same effects in COPD patients. Metformin is safe and cheap, and has been extensively used in COPD patients with diabetes with an excellent safety record. The primary aim of this study will be to determine whether metformin reduces lung glucose in a small group of non-diabetic COPD patients.

It is estimated that about 50% of people are infected with this bacterium in Taiwan. Many studies have shown that H. pylori is an important causal factor of chronic gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, gastric cancer and gastric lymphoma. The World Health Organization classified H. pylori as a Group 1 carcinogen in 1994. Endoscopic examination is indicated to confirm the above diagnosis for patient with H. pylori infection. Eradication of H. pylori infection reduces the risk of gastric cancer and recurrence of peptic ulcer disease. However, the eradication rate of clarithromycin-based triple therapy has been declining in recent years, probably related to the increasing resistant rate to clarithromycin. Several strategies have been proposed to overcome the declining eradication rate, including (1) extending the treatment duration of triple therapy to 14 days; (2) the use of bismuth quadruple therapy which contains bismuth, a proton pump inhibitor, and two antibiotics (usually metronidazole and tetracycline); (3) non-bismuth quadruple therapy (concomitant therapy) which contains a proton pump inhibitor and three antibiotics (usually amoxicillin, metronidazole, and clarithromycin); (4) sequential therapy which contains a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) plus amoxicillin for five days, followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin and tinidazole for another five days.

532,"Completed","Cotrimoxazole preventive therapy (CPT) is recommended for prevention of morbidity and mortality due to Pneumocystis pneumonia and other infections in HIV positive patients with low immunity. Common clinical practice is to start CPT in any patient with CD4 counts below 200/µL, and, conversely, to stop CPT when immunity has been restored by antiretroviral treatment to CD4 counts above 200/µL or when viral suppression has been documented for 3 months. However, the latest WHO guidelines widely expands the indication for CPT by advocating for settings with high prevalence of malaria and bacterial infections, that all patients with HIV start CPT regardless of CD4 counts and clinical stage. Furthermore, WHO recommends these patients to continue CPT indefinitely regardless of evidence of immune restoration (The recommendation is for settings with high prevalence of malaria and bacterial infections, not for high-income countries). There is limited scientific evidence to recommend prolonged CPT, as studies have shown it is associated with modestly reduced morbidity due to pneumonia, meningitis and malaria, but no corresponding reduction in mortality. The impact of such a large increase in antibiotic use on the emergence of antimicrobial resistance has not been thoroughly considered. Our previous studies in Tanzania showed that multidrug-resistant bacteria frequently cause bloodstream infections with resultant very high case-fatality rates. As genes encoding for multiple antibiotic resistance traits are transferred by plasmids together with resistance towards cotrimoxazole, prolonged CPT will likely favor the selection of carriage of multidrug-resistant gut bacteria. The proposed randomized clinical trial is designed to assess whether prolonged CPT in HIV-positive patients results in increased fecal carriage of multi-drug resistant gut microbes or increased nasal carriage of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Secondary endpoints are morbidity (clinical events, hospitalizations) and mortality. Stool specimens, nasal swabs and clinical data will be collected from persons attending voluntary counseling and testing facilities and HIV-clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. The study results may have important impact on public health in terms of assisting development of rational recommendations for CPT use, and may help prevent emerging antibiotic resistance.","HIV-1-infection|Pneumocystis Pneumonia|Opportunistic Infections|Preventive Therapy|Antibiotic Side Effect","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","March 30, 2017","July 25, 2019","Cotrimoxazole|Placebo","Drug|Drug","Phase 4","All",,"18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Tanzania|Tanzania|Tanzania|Tanzania|Tanzania|Tanzania","Randomized","537",,

Antibiotics have shown their efficacy by direct antimicrobial activity and their limit particularly in case of multidrug-resistant microorganisms or in treating patients with aggravating pathologies. Innate immunity could be an alternative or complementary therapeutic pathway. Innate immunity receptors bind universal and invariant microbial molecular patterns present in bacteria, virus, fungus or parasite. Toll-like Receptors (TLR) activation by microbial agonist stimulates the innate immunity response which results in the production of chemokines, cytokines, antimicrobial molecules and the recruitment of innate cells.||The "" Pulmonary Infection and Innate Immunity "" team of the Immunity and Infection Center in Lille (Group of Dr. Sirard and Carnoy) has a long expertise in the study of TLR5 and its agonist, the flagellin, a structural protein of bacterial flagella. TLR5 is expressed on the cell surface of macrophages, monocytes, dendritic and epithelial cells. Several studies in mice have shown the flagellin prophylactic potential during bacterial infections through a TLR5 dependent stimulation of innate immunity. Recently, the group of Dr. Sirard and Carnoy has shown that flagellin can be used in association with antibiotics to treat Streptococcus pneumoniae respiratory infections in mice. The results demonstrate that an agonist of TLR can increase the therapeutic index of an antibiotic and improve the pulmonary anti-infectious reaction. This innovative approach allows us to consider new antibacterial strategies where antibiotics have reached their limit (nosocomial infection, multidrug-resistant bacteria…).

Indeed, blood cells activation by TLR agonists have been recently characterized in healthy volunteers.||However, there is no available data on the ability of TLR agonists to activate cells from patients with infectious pneumopathies.

However, early onset neonatal infection (EONI), which is defined as an infection occurring during the first 6 days after birth (as opposed to late onset neonatal infections (LONI) occurring between days 7-89), is still one of the leading causes of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Physicians consider EONI a significant diagnostic and therapeutic emergency due to the potential for sudden onset and rapid evolution of sepsis in newborns with immature immune systems. Currently, in France, detection of EONI is based on national consensus guidelines published in 2002 (ANAES recommendations). There are broad indications to provide empirical antibiotic treatment pending diagnostic confirmation through different complementary exams. To ensure that every infected newborn is diagnosed, biological assessments are often repeated and result in the use of invasive and painful procedures, anemia and financial concerns. Moreover, in cases of abnormal biological results, many newborns are subjected to intravenous (IV) antibiotic treatments requiring hospitalization and separation from their mother. However recent studies have shown that antibiotics can have a potentially deleterious effect on the neonatal digestive microbiota and result in the appearance of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, with possible long-term consequences on the health of the child.||Procalcitonin (PCT) is a calcitonin prohormone secreted from the parenchymal tissues. This marker of inflammation has been shown to be a valuable diagnostic marker for bacterial infection in adults and in children. It also seems to be a reliable marker for neonatal bacterial infection, which would make it useful in the detection of EONI. Because physiological levels of PCT vary during the first days of life, possibly due to postnatal intestinal bacterial colonization, levels of this marker are difficult to interpret in the early neonatal period. However, in a study of 2151 newborns with suspected EONI, Nicolas Joram et al. found that PCT obtained from the umbilical blood cord, prior to newborn intestinal colonization, bypasses this postnatal physiological peak of PCT and effectively constitutes a discriminant marker to distinguish between infected and healthy infants using a cutoff value of 0.6 ng/ml.||Subsequent to this pilot study, several studies on PCT in umbilical blood cord confirmed its good diagnostic performance for EONI, particularly when included in a diagnostic algorithm. This marker could contribute to a better estimation of EONI risk in order to limit the use of unnecessary complementary exams and prescription of antibiotics and their associated short- and long-term side effects in healthy newborns.||Therefore, in this study, the investigators propose to test the diagnostic value of a PCT-based algorithm in newborns suspected of having EONI. The investigators hypothesize that this algorithm is as efficient as those currently used (ANAES), but will limit coinciding biological exams and exposure to antibiotics during the neonatal period.","Early-onset Neonatal Infection","No","Observational","May 3, 2016","January 22, 2017","ANAES algorithm|PCT algorithm","Other|Other",,"All",,,,,"France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France|France",,"9201",,

Minor injuries that would normally heal without consequence in non-diabetic individuals are at greater risk of bacterial infection and progression to non healing (chronic) wound status in diabetics, largely due to a loss of sensation in limbs (neuropathy) and decreased blood flow (vascular disease). If not treated efficiently and effectively, DFUs can have serious complications e.g. amputation, sepsis and death. The investigators propose to address this significant unmet clinical need using a novel commercial handheld fluorescence imaging product called the MolecuLight i:X (MolecuLight Inc.) which images clinically-significant wound bacteria without contrast agents or patient contact. Evidence in animal models of chronic wounds and multiple published clinical trials (mainly DFUs) have shown significant clinical potential for fluorescence imaging to detect potentially harmful bacteria in wounds otherwise invisible to doctors. The investigators have shown that clinicians can easily, objectively and more accurately determine the likelihood of bacterial infection than the standard of care. Moreover, published clinical evidence has shown fluorescence imaging enables more accurate microbial wound sampling and guides more targeted debridement of wounds to reduce bacteria levels. Our pilot data also show that when used like this, the i:X device accelerates DFU wound healing, compared with current methods. Thus, the investigators propose to expand the current pilot studies through a statistically-powered 3 y randomized controlled trial to test the therapeutic benefit of fluorescence-guided treatment for DFUs in a larger group of patients.

593,"Completed","In the past 70 years antibiotics have served as the first line of defense against infectious diseases. However, antibiotics are only effective against bacterial infections and are not the solution for infections caused by viruses such as common colds or flu. Despite their contribution to healthcare, antibiotics are currently recognized as the most misused drugs in the world with global overuse estimated at 40%-70%, mostly due to the ineffectiveness of current diagnostic solutions to distinguish between bacterial and viral infections. Antibiotics misuse often causes preventable adverse events that impact patient care and lead to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, one of the major threats to global health today. To address these challenges, MeMed has been developing the ImmunoDx™, a novel technology that relies on the best available detection system for differentiating between viruses and bacteria - the body's own immune system. The ImmunoDx™ technology employs a simple blood test that provides the physician, within two-hours, the information he needs to decide whether to treat the patient with antibiotics or not. This technology has been tested on over 1000 patients of different ages and diseases and was found to be highly accurate and safe. The current study is a non-interventional study and the participants do not receive any investigational drug nor any experimental examination or procedure. Therefore, the collected data in this study will not affect the diagnosis, prognosis, or treatment of the participants. Participation includes the collection of a teaspoon of blood and collection of a specimen using a nasal swab. These procedures are common in the clinical practice and are widely performed and possess no significant risk. By participating in the study, the subjects impact the development of the ImmunoDx™ technology, which is expected to enable a future faster and more accurate diagnosis of infectious diseases as well as more appropriate prescription of antibiotics. This will open the way to improve treatment decisions in millions of patients around the world.","Lower Respiratory Tract Infection|Unspecified Fever","No","Observational","October 2013","November 2016",,,,"All","60 Months","1 Month",,,"Israel|Israel|Netherlands",,"777",,
594,"Completed","Hypotheses and Specific Aims:||The continued emergence of antibiotic-resistance in the outpatient setting underlines the need to responsibly manage antimicrobial prescribing. It is in this context that we seek to test an effective strategy for reducing the inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary care office practices. Our overall objective is to identify an effective and efficient strategy for decreasing the contribution of primary care clinicians to the emergence of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in the community and to disseminate widely those strategies found to be effective and sustainable.||We hypothesize that implementation of a clinician decision support system, with an active education component, will reduce the inappropriate use of antibiotics in primary care office practices. Our hypothesis is based on the premise that most inappropriate prescribing is the result of multiple factors that include difficulty in distinguishing a benign, self-limited viral infection from a more serious bacterial infection; overdiagnosis of a bacterial infection in cases where there is clinical uncertainty as to the true nature of the illness; and constraints on the time available for clinicians to explain to patients the nature of the illness and the reasons an antibiotic is not indicated.||The focus of this proposal will be to compare the impact of clinical decision support and active education to no intervention for enhancing the appropriate use of antimicrobials for common outpatient infections. In this randomized control trial, primary care providers participating in the intervention arm will receive active education coupled with the implementation of a clinical decision support tool, while providers in the control arm will have no intervention. At the end of the study, providers in the control arm will receive a thorough analysis of their antibiotic prescribing patterns and suggested opportunities for improvement, as well as access to the intervention tools once the study has ended.||Our interdisciplinary team will integrate novel methods in implementation science with clinical and laboratory expertise in infectious diseases, antimicrobial stewardship, primary care, information technology, performance improvement, health services research, and biostatistics. The Specific Aims are constructed to validate our hypothesis in the primary care setting by demonstrating two results of our intervention strategy:||Reduced use of antibiotics to treat conditions for which those drugs are known not to be effective|Decreased prescribing of broad-spectrum antibiotics to treat common bacterial infections.||The degree of impact in terms of prescriptions per 100 visits for each targeted outpatient infection will be compared with active education and clinical decision support versus no intervention.

595,"Completed","Among enterobacteria, the production of ESBL is the first cause of multidrug resistance. The first cases of ESBL-producing enterobacteriaceae (EBLSE) infections were described during the 1980s and subsequently experienced global spread. Since the beginning of the century, the prevalence of EBLSE infections, especially among E. coli and K. pneumoniae, has increased dramatically. The emergence of multidrug-resistant enterobacteria is currently posing a real public health problem. The European antimicrobial resistance surveillance network evaluated, among clinical strains, the resistance rate for 3rd generation cephalosporins (C3G) at 9.5% for Escherichia coli and 28% for Klebsiella pneumoniae. The consequences of multidrug-resistant enterobacterial infections, which are mainly represented by ESBLs, are currently well known, both from the individual point of view (increase in mortality and length of hospital stay) and collective (increase of costs of care).||Data from the literature reveal an increased risk of ESBL bacteremia in patients with rectal carriage of ESBL-producing enterobacteria. The study by Goulenok et al. found as a risk factor for EBLSE bacteremia in patients known to be carriers at the rectal level the existence of antibiotic selection pressure and the presence of a urinary catheter. Woerther et al. have explained in their work that the digestive microbiota confers resistance to colonization by BMR. The impact of antibiotics on the latter leads to a probable rupture of this barrier and a loss of this resistance to colonization. In addition, each antibiotherapy does not impact the digestive microbiota equally and it seems that antibiotics with high anti-anaerobic activity or high biliary elimination are the most impacting. It is therefore essential, at a time of multidrug resistance, to focus on the influence of antibiotics on the digestive microbiota and the emergence and carriage of BMR.||Ceftriaxone and cefotaxime are two injectable injectable third-generation cephalosporins (C3G) commonly used in clinical practice. Despite their similar spectrum of action, it should be noted that they have substantially different pharmacokinetic properties, especially with regard to their half-life and their elimination routes (mainly urinary for cefotaxime, mixed: biliary and urinary for ceftriaxone). Some works have already been interested in this topic. Grohs et al. carried out a comparative study between ceftriaxone and cefotaxime on the emergence of AmpC hyperproducing enterobacteria (HL-CASE). This single-site study demonstrated that, at a hospital level, the preferential use of cefotaxime rather than ceftriaxone had collective and ecological benefits at the service level. Indeed, their results conclude that resistance development is weaker, as well as more limited carriage of HL-CASE Enterobacterial strains by replacing ceftriaxone with cefotaxime. It should be noted, however, that the modification of prescribing practices of C3G has been coupled with various measures to limit the emergence of AmpC hyperproductive enterobacteria (reinforcement of hygiene rules, awareness of the health care team at EBLSE, control of antibiotic ...).||In a context where the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria continues to increase, it seems appropriate to conduct a study to compare the impact of the use of ceftriaxone or cefotaxime on the emergence of BMR at the individual level. In the absence of a study clearly establishing the link between C3G types (ceftriaxone, cefotaxime) and the emergence of BMR and in line with the above research, this study aims to compare the microbiological impact of the use of either of these two C3Gs (in terms of emergence of bacterial resistance and impact on the diversity and quantity of digestive digestive bacteria). The study will have two periods: Period 1 during which patients hospitalized in the emergency department or in internal medicine and receiving C3G antibiotics will receive ceftriaxone, and the period 2 during which cefotaxime is cephalosporin used in first intention in these same patients.||Thus, this research project, by focusing on these 5 parameters in patients treated with ceftriaxone or cefotaxime, should make it possible to prove the influence of these antibiotherapies on the carriage of BMR (deleterious action on the diversity and the quantity of the intestinal bacterial flora, resulting in an increase in the relative fecal abundance of these BMRs promoting their carriage). In addition, the hypothesis is that, contrary to current data, cefotaxime is found at sufficiently high concentrations in the feces to have an impact on the microbiota equivalent to that of ceftriaxone, despite less significant biliary elimination.||This study therefore aims to compare their impacts on the microbiota and in particular on the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria (BMR) and enteropathogens such as Clostridium difficile.","Infection, Bacterial","No","Interventional","April 30, 2019","August 13, 2021","Cefotaxime|Ceftriaxone","Other|Other","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Other","Parallel Assignment","France","Non-Randomized","34",,

Macrolides are the essential component of successful therapy, yet macrolide resistant strains are being recognized with increasing frequency. Thus, there is an interest in identifying additional therapeutic interventions for disseminated MAC in HIV-infected patients. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is a central, regulatory cytokine in cell-mediated immunity.

Fifteen patients with documented disseminated MAC will be randomized to receive double-blinded placebo or escalating doses of IL-12 in addition to anti-MAC chemotherapy and standard anti-retroviral therapy for six weeks. IL-12 will be administered subcutaneously, with escalating doses every month over the dose range of 30 ng/kg, 100 ng/kg, and 300 ng/kg, or until an individual maximum tolerated dose (IMTD) is reached. Should a patient receive 2 consecutive blood cultures negative for MAC during the course of the study at a lower dose, then he/she will not be further dose escalated.

It is one of the most common bacterial causes of acute febrile illness in the developing world, with an estimated 10.9 million new cases worldwide and 116.8 thousand deaths in 2017. Like many febrile illnesses, typhoid presents with non-specific symptoms and signs, especially in its early stages. In routine healthcare settings in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), typhoid fever is commonly suspected and treated empirically with antibiotics. This overuse of antibiotics creates a selective pressure for the development of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), that has resulted in the emergence and spread of typhoid strains that are resistant to all first-line antibiotics. Similarly, the low specificity of current rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) can lead to an over diagnosis of typhoid fever that may result in the overuse of antibiotics and delay the proper treatment for underlying conditions.

Although PNTM infection is most common in people with lung diseases, it can also affect healthy people. It can be difficult to treat, and affects parts of the body other than the lungs. For example, PNTM may affect the cilia, the hair-like structures inside the nose and lungs that help move dirt and debris out of the body.|Ciliary beat frequency (CBF) is a measurement of how fast cilia move. People with PNTM infection have a lower CBF than healthy people. Nitric oxide (NO) is a gas in the body that may affect CBF. People with PNTM infection produce lower amounts of NO in their noses than healthy people. Researchers want to see if a drug called sildenafil can increase NO production and CBF. If sildenafil can improve these measurements, it may be a useful treatment for PNTM infection.||Objectives:||- To study the effect of sildenafil on CBF and NO levels in people with PNTM infection.||Eligibility:||Individuals at least 18 years of age who have PNTM infection.|Participants must be enrolled in a related National Institutes of Health study on bacterial infections.

The second line treatment is cefotaxime or ceftriaxone.||Severe bacterial infections are common in infants under 2 months of age and the mortality is very high (~50%). There are several reasons for this; one is that the first line antibiotics used are no longer as effective as they used to be. Bacterial resistance to the first line antibiotics has increased and some infections especially of the central nervous system may only be partly treated and not eradicated by present therapy. First line treatment is cheap and available but requires 4 injections a day, for at least 14 days, a total of 58 injections. Many mothers find this number too much and abscond. The investigators second line therapy is ceftriaxone which is also available and cheap and the advantage of being given as a daily injection. The disadvantage is that it can cause (reversible) jaundice particularly in premature babies and it must not be given with calcium products. The investigators do not give calcium to the investigators infants as the investigators cannot routinely check electrolytes.

645,"Withdrawn","Tuberculosis (TB) is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in organ transplant recipients. Management of tuberculosis in this setting is challenging due to the complexity of diagnosis and the potential toxicity of anti-TB therapy, especially in liver transplant candidates and recipients. Although the tuberculin skin test (TST) is recommended for screening of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in all candidates for liver transplantation, the performance of the TST in this setting is less than optimal, due to a lack of specificity (false-positive results due to interaction with BCG vaccine and other mycobacterial infections), and a lack of sensitivity in a population that is relatively immunocompromised. Recently, a new test named QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) has been approved for the diagnosis of LTBI. QFT-G detects the release of interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) by sensitized white cells after incubation of whole blood with TB antigens. QFT-G is expected to be more specific than TST. However, there are no studies defining the performance of QFT-G in a population of patients on a waiting list for liver transplantation. We plan to estimate the usefulness of the QFT-G test for the diagnosis of LTBI in a cohort of patients with end-stage liver disease. We hypothesize that the QFT-G test will correlate better with the risk of LTBI. This study advances research on the prevention of a serious bacterial infection that can have devastating consequences in the post-transplant setting. The new diagnostic strategy may more accurately determine the presence of LTBI, thereby allowing appropriate therapy.","Chronic Liver Disease|TB","No","Interventional","January 2007",,"collection of blood sample","Procedure","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Diagnostic","Single Group Assignment","United States","Non-Randomized","0",,

Over 30 different types of the pneumococcus germ can cause invasive disease, but 7 types (namely serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F and 23F) are responsible for around 75% of cases in young children. A pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against these 7 serotypes (PCV7; Prevenar ®, Wyeth Vaccines) was introduced into the UK national immunisation programme in September 2006 and has resulted in a rapid reduction in pneumococcal disease caused by the 7 serotypes among both vaccinated children and older unvaccinated children and adults through herd immunity. By 2009, over half of all invasive pneumococcal cases in young children were caused by six other pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A) that are included in a newly licensed 13 valent pneumococcal vaccine (PCV13; Prevenar 13®, Wyeth Vaccines). In April 2010, PCV13 replaced PCV7 in the UK immunisation programme with the aim of further reducing cases of invasive pneumococcal disease. The antibody responses induced by the 7 serotypes in both PCV13 and PCV7 have been shown to be comparable, but the protection offered by the additional 6 serotypes in PCV13 merits further study. Also, it is possible that the use of PCV13 instead of PCV7 may interfere with immune responses to other vaccines, such as Haemophilus influenzae serotype b (Hib), which are given to infants at the same time as PCV13. The proposed study will aim to collect one blood sample from infants after they receive their routine vaccinations at 2, 3 and 4 months in order to their measure immune responses to routine vaccines. The investigators hope that their results will help us better understand the added protection offered by the 13valent pneumococcal vaccine and ensure that children are adequately protected by the other vaccines they receive.","Streptococcus Pneumoniae","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","November 2010","June 2013",,,,"All","6 Months",,,,"United Kingdom",,"93",,

Nystatin is the only topical antifungal that does not interact with other drugs and to which the majority of the candida species are susceptible.

699,"Completed","Though maternal and neonatal health are high priority areas for international development, maternal and neonatal mortality remain unacceptably high. Worldwide there are 1 million maternal and 4 million neonatal deaths every year and half of them occur in sub-Saharan Africa.||Post-partum and neonatal severe bacterial infections, namely sepsis, are leading causes of maternal and neonatal deaths in sub-Saharan Africa. Newborns can be infected during labour - when passing through the birth canal - and also during the first days/weeks of life, as a consequence of the close physical contact with the mother, when the latter carriers bacteria. As the mother is an important source of bacterial transmission to the newborn, treating mothers with antibiotics during labour should decrease their bacterial carriage and therefore lower transmission to the newborn. As carriage is a necessary step towards severe disease, this intervention should in turn result in the lower occurrence of severe bacterial disease and mortality during the neonatal period.||In many high-income countries, pregnant women are screened during pregnancy for vaginal carriage of Group B Streptococcus, the bacteria responsible for the vast majority of neonatal sepsis in the developed world. If women are carriers, they are treated with intravenous antibiotics during labour to decrease the risk of severe disease to their off-spring. Although this intervention has been successful in developed countries, infrastructure and resource limitations in regions like sub-Saharan Africa prevent both screening and use of intravenous antibiotics. Also, in Africa several bacterial pathogens are responsible for neonatal sepsis and the antibiotics needed in the continent should cover a wider number of bacteria; and ideally cover also bacteria responsible for severe post-partum disease in the mother.||We will conduct a large trial in West Africa, The Gambia and Burkina Faso, with the main objective of determining if a single dose of an oral antibiotic given to women during labour decreases newborn mortality. The trial will also assess the effect of the antibiotic on lowering newborns and maternal hospitalization during the first week's post-partum. We have selected an antibiotic (azithromycin) that in sub-Saharan Africa has already been used for elimination of other prevalent diseases such as trachoma. This antibiotic is safe, requires a single oral administration, has no special storage requirements and has the potential to eliminate most of the bacteria commonly causing severe disease in newborns and post-partum women in the continent. Very important this antibiotic is not widely used in clinical care in the continent, and therefore, any temporal increase of resistance induced by the intervention should not have implications on current treatment guidelines.||Before going to the large trial proposed here (12,000 women to be recruited), we have generated robust preliminary data on the effect of the intervention in a proof-of-concept trial conducted in The Gambia (829 women and their offspring recruited). We found that in fact, babies born from mothers who had taken this antibiotic during labour were less likely to carry bacteria that can potentially cause severe disease. These babies were also three times less likely to have bacterial skin infections or umbilical infections, both highly common among African newborns. Besides, fever or mastitis (again both very common in the region) during the post-partum period were four times lower among mothers who had taken the antibiotic during labour. Such trial confirmed our hypothesis of impact on bacterial transmission but it was too small to assess the effect of the antibiotic on mortality and hospitalizations. The preliminary trial also showed that women from the azithromycin group were less likely to need antibiotics for treatment infections during the puerperal period, decreasing then the pressure on the scarcity of antibiotics available in the continent.||The advantages of our approach are its simplicity, low cost and the possibility of protecting both mothers and babies with the same intervention.","Neonatal SEPSIS","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","October 21, 2017","May 31, 2021","Azithromycin|Placebo Oral Tablet","Drug|Drug","Phase 3","Female",,"16 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Burkina Faso|Gambia","Randomized","11985",,

This sometimes progresses to a sudden and severe illness. The present treatment for fulminant colitis is a total abdominal colectomy with end ileostomy. This means, a surgery is performed which removes the entire diseased colon. The end of the small intestine is then brought out to the front of the abdomen as a stoma, and the patient wears a bag. Despite this invasive treatment, there remains a significant rate of death (38-50%). In addition, patients have a long recovery after this long operation and many (67%) will not be fit for a second big operation to remove the stoma (that is to reconnect the intestine).||The purpose of our study is to determine if a loop ileostomy with colonic lavage will result in better outcomes. A loop ileostomy is when a loop of small intestine is brought out to the abdomen and the colon remains in the abdomen. The diseased colon, which is preserved, is washed with a warm solution (like the solution used in a colonoscopy preparation) and then treated with an antibiotic via this ileostomy. So far, one study has been done using a loop ileostomy with colonic lavage. 42 patients who underwent this treatment were compared to 42 patients that underwent the standard of care (complete removal of the colon with end ileostomy). The 42 patients who underwent a loop ileostomy showed a significant decrease in rate of death compared to the standard of care. Also, in the study, patients who underwent a loop ileostomy had a much higher rate of reconnection of the intestine (closing the stoma). The purpose of this study is to see if a loop ileostomy with colonic lavage can treat patients with fulminant colitis with less risk of death than the standard of care.||Once the patient is diagnosed with fulminant colitis and meets the eligibility criteria, he/she will be asked by the surgeon on-call if they would like to participate in this research study. If they agree to be in this study, they must first sign a consent form. They may be asked by the surgeon to enroll in either the investigational arm (loop ileostomy) or the standard of care arm. After surgery, all patients will receive the same standard routine care. During the hospital stay, information will be taken from their chart for purposes of the study. Routine follow up visits with their surgeon will be at 2, 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery. If the patient decides to be in the study, the patient will be expected to complete all the follow up study visits. The patient will not be required to do anything extra or have any extra tests if they decide to be in the study at any of these visits.","Fulminant Clostridium Difficile Colitis","No","Interventional","January 2015","November 30, 2019","Loop Ileostomy with colonic lavage|Total Abdominal Colectomy with end ileostomy","Procedure|Procedure","Not Applicable","All","110 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Canada","Non-Randomized","12",,

Recent reviews have also recommended BPG as the first-line treatment of early syphilis, reporting a success rate of more than 90% over a large panel of studies. This form of the drug provides weeks of treponemicidal levels of penicillin in the blood, but does not efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier.||However, despite the use of BPG for almost 70 years and its status as the gold standard treatment for early syphilis, the need to administer this antibiotic parenterally has led to the use of second-line oral antibiotics, including firstgeneration macrolides, and then second-generation macrolides, such as azithromycin. Several African studies have shown 1 g azithromycin bid treatment for one day to be effective against early syphilis, but most authors agree that azithromycin should not generally be used as resistance to this macrolide is highly prevalent in Western countries. Moreover, a recent study by our group showed that more than 80% of the treponemal strains isolated in France harbor the mutation conferring resistance to azithromycin. The use of this alternative would, therefore, be highly unlikely to be effective in France. Tetracycline antibiotics have also been proposed as an alternative in patients with a contraindication for BPG or other forms of penicillin. Doxycycline, at a dose of 100 mg orally twice daily for 14 days, has been endorsed as a preferred alternative treatment, but few data are available concerning its efficacy. This issue is crucial, for two main reasons: there has been a recrudescence of early syphilis in most western countries over the last 20 years, increasing the need for BPG, and two periods of BPG shortage were experienced in 2013 and 2017, leading to the use of alternative treatments due to the temporary unavailability of BPG or its limitation to cases in which no other treatment was possible. Data for the manufacturing and distribution of antibiotics are not publicly available, but reports of limited availability, shortages, and price increases for old antibiotics suggest that the current system is too fragile to provide what should be a given in modern medicine: access to effective treatment for common and potentially severe bacterial infections. The recurrence of BPG shortages over the last five years has created an urgent need to demonstrate that doxycycline is safe, or at least as safe as BPG, for treating early syphilis. The investigators hypothesize that the recommended doxycycline regimen is not inferior to BPG and plan to test this hypothesis in a randomized clinical trial.","Syphilis","No","Interventional","November 2021","November 2023","BPG|Doxycycline","Drug|Drug","Phase 3","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","France","Randomized","200",,

The hospital mortality of NSTI is high, comprised between 20 and 30%. NSTIs represent the 4th cause of septic shock. Early management of NSTIs requires a coordinated and multidisciplinary approach, including broad-spectrum antibiotic administration, management of organ failures and aggressive surgical debridement with excision of all necrotic and infected tissues. NSTIs involve the lower limbs in about 70% of cases and lead in 15% of cases to limb amputation. During the early post-operative phase, daily wound care is required using conventional dressings. As soon as the infectious process is controlled, typically within 7 to 10 days of the initial debridement, the main goal of wound dressing is to allow for a granulation tissue to develop so that to perform a skin grafting. Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT), which consists in applying a negative pressure on the wound surface, may be used to this effect. A dedicated dressing is connected to a device that generates a negative pressure and collects exudates. NPWT may have a positive effect on wound healing by removing exudate, increasing regional perfusion and patient comfort and reducing infections. Beneficial effects of NPWT have been suggested by case series. However, no randomized controlled trial are currently available to adequately assess its efficiency and the 2014 guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) on NSTI did not provide recommendations regarding NPWT use for managing NSTI wounds.

Women with recurrent UTIs are commonly treated with antibiotics, but side effects, collateral damage to commensal bacteria, and antimicrobial resistance result from frequent antibiotic use. It is paramount that researchers develop non-antibiotic treatment strategies for UTIs.||Several non-antibiotic strategies may be successful in preventing recurrent UTIs in postmenopausal women, including low-dose vaginal estrogen, d-mannose, and methenamine hippurate. Methenamine hippurate (MH) is interesting as it causes few side effects, kills bacteria by denaturing bacterial proteins, RNA, and DNA, and does not develop resistance. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of daily methenamine on the incidence of UTI. However, women often require multiple therapies in order to prevent recurrence. There are currently few guidelines to help clinicians identify optimal treatment regimens for non-antibiotic prevention of UTI.||The purpose of this pilot study is to examine the feasibility of developing a sequential, multiple assignment, randomization trial (SMART); and examine the treatment effect of MH in combination with vaginal estrogen (VET) and D-mannose on prevention of UTI. The investigators plan to examine the efficacy of the addition of MH to low dose VET and d-mannose in the UTI prevention through randomization to MH + VET + D-mannose vs continuing VET + D-mannose alone. The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients who have symptomatic, culture-proven UTI during a 3 month treatment period. The investigators hypothesize that women on low dose VET, d-mannose, and MH will be less likely to have recurrent UTI than those with VET and d-mannose alone.||This study uses a pragmatic, longitudinal approach that mimics patients' clinical experiences and physicians' decision points during management of UTI prophylaxis. Through this randomized, controlled pilot study, this proposal would allow the investigators to examine the feasibility of conducting a larger-scale, adaptive study trial, and estimate the treatment effect of a non-antibiotic regimen augmented with MH in women who continue to develop recurrence.","UTI|Female Urogenital Diseases|UTI - Lower Urinary Tract Infection","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","September 1, 2020","November 5, 2021","Methenamine Hippurate 1000 MG|Vaginal estrogen|D-mannose","Drug|Drug|Dietary Supplement","Phase 4","Female",,"18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment",,"Randomized","120",,

Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is one of the most frequent infections in cirrhosis and therefore a trigger for ACLF. ACLF is characterized by systemic inflammation even in the absence of confirmed infection and associated with poor outcome. The source of ascites infection, especially in case of culture-positive SBP and bacterascites, is suspected to be bacterial translocation from gut.||In decompensated cirrhosis, data on the gut microbial translocation in different circulatory compartments is limited. Moreover, the link between gut microbiome and systemic inflammation in liver disease has still not established.||The transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) is applied to treat portal hypertension which frequently leads to intestinal bleeding, life-threatening esophageal bleeding and ascites.

It would be irrelevant to the infection once the patients are infected, i.e., to symptomatic treatment of COVID-19 infection.||Anti-inflammatory effect masking the early symptoms of bacterial infections resulting in later antibiotic or other treatment is not applicable: there is no treatment of the virus that might be affected by masking symptoms.||Antipyretic effect increasing the risk or the severity of infection would apply equally to all antipyretic agents including paracetamol, which share the same mechanism of action for fever reduction.||EMA remains prudent about this assertion||In addition, excess reliance on paracetamol while discouraging the use of ibuprofen might increase the risk of hepatic injury from paracetamol overdose.

It has been shown that innate immune defence, represented by dysfunction of neutrophil granulocytes, is impaired in chronic kidney disease. Another impact of chronic kidney disease on innate immunity is the chronic activation of neutrophils leading to high levels of inflammatory cytokines, thus contributing to protein oxidation. Oxidation of human serum albumin (HSA), the major plasma protein, occurs in chronic kidney disease and leads to further activation of neutrophils. Another important impact of HSA oxidation is the decrease of its binding capacity leading to impaired detoxification ability of albumin. This includes reduced clearance of endotoxin, a major component of the gram negative bacterial cell wall. Circulating endotoxin is recognized by complex formation with lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) followed by binding to CD14 and toll-like receptor (TLR) 4. High systemic endotoxin levels occur in chronic kidney disease and may be the result of decreased clearance ability of HSA and increased gut permeability in combination with intestinal bacterial overgrowth. High systemic endotoxin is associated with worse outcome in several diseases and could be used as predictor for mortality in chronic kidney disease patients.||Endotoxemia in renal insufficiency leads to impaired neutrophil function and to increased albumin oxidation. Oxidized albumin is not able to bind endotoxin adequately any more, which leads to a further increase in oxidative stress and neutrophil dysfunction, resulting in a vicious cycle.||195 patients with renal dysfunction will be enrolled and divided into 5 groups.

The hypotheses addressed by this study are as follows: Provision of vitamin A supplements to newborns at risk of vitamin A deficiency will (1) improve functioning of the thymus (the source of T lymphocytes, cells of the immune system that are important in response to infection and immunization); (2) enhance T lymphocyte-mediated responses to standard vaccines given at birth and early in infancy; and (3) improve gut barrier function (i.e., ability to prevent bacterial infection across the epithelial barrier), relative to provision of a placebo.","Vitamin A Deficiency","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","January 2012","August 2014","retinyl palmitate|Placebo","Dietary Supplement|Dietary Supplement","Not Applicable","All","48 Hours",,"Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Bangladesh","Randomized","300",,

When a febrile infant presents to a healthcare site, such as an emergency room, a large number of tests are usually performed, which may include a procalcitonin (PCT) level. PCT is being increasingly recognized as an inflammatory marker suggestive of serious bacterial infection, and is being used in clinical practice in the workup for acute febrile illness. Based on an elevated PCT level, further testing may be done, antibiotics may be started, and the patient may get admitted to the hospital for observation before identifying the cause of the elevated PCT level. The investigators believe that immunizations can cause an increase in PCT levels in the absence of an acute infection. Thus, a finding of elevated procalcitonin in a recently immunized child may not have the same clinical implication as it does in other clinical scenarios. To investigate this, the investigators designed this pilot prospective study to compare PCT levels immediately before and forty-eight hours after the administration of routine infant immunizations.

We also want to determine whether such test would help us to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and help us to find faster the real cause of the fever.||A total of 90 patients with the unexplained fever will be participating in this study. This study will involve single, additional blood test, performed only if patient continue to have fever despite a few days of investigations and therapy with antibiotics.||Patients will be assigned by drawing to one of two groups. In the first group blood test (procalcitonin) will help a doctor to decide whether to stop or continue antibiotics. If procalcitonin level is high antibiotics will be continued and the doctor will most probably order additional tests to determine the source of infection. If procalcitonin level is low serious bacterial infection is unlikely. The antibiotics will be stopped and a doctor will try to look for other cause of fever.||In the second group blood for the tests will be collected but not reported to a doctor.

Adherence on surfaces, and resistance to both antibiotic treatments and host defenses are ones of the major clinical features of bacterial biofilms. Hence, biofilm formations represent a serious clinical problem: they persist in human tissues and play a role in a large number of chronic and resistant infections. It has been estimated that more than 65% of all human bacterial infections involve biofilms. Recently, the investigators have demonstrated the presence of mucosal bacterial biofilms in adenoid tissues removed during routine adenoidectomy. Bacterial biofilms were visualized using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM) with a technique of double staining showing both the bacterial cells and the glycocalyx matrix. Although this study clearly established that adenoids tissues can harbour mucosal biofilms, the prevalence of 54% the investigators found suggested that some groups of children may contain more biofilm formations than others. In an effort to relate the findings of mucosal biofilm with the clinical presentation, the investigators have designed the present work to compare the prevalence of mucosal biofilms in adenoidectomy specimens in two groups: one group of children with chronic otitis media (COM) with effusion versus another group of children without any COM, having adenoids removed for chronic obstruction.","Chronic Serous Otitis Media, Simple or Unspecified","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","July 2010","May 2012","With chronic middle ear effusion|Without chronic middle ear effusion","Procedure|Procedure","Not Applicable","All","10 Years","18 Months","Health Services Research","Parallel Assignment","France","Non-Randomized","113",,

Nevertheless why some people develop COPD while others, including many smokers do not, is poorly understood. A central feature of COPD is accumulation of a particular type of white blood cell, the neutrophil, which is a key component in defence against bacterial infection in the lung airway. As disease progresses the small airways of many patients with COPD start to accumulate bacteria, which are normally lacking in the small airways of healthy individuals or smokers who lack COPD. The accumulation of bacteria in the smaller airways of many patients with COPD may be important to the development of the disease. Researchers will test if blood cells, which normally ingest and kill bacteria, have a reduced ability to perform this function in patients with COPD and whether the clearance of these blood cells after they have performed their role in protecting against infection is impaired. Researchers will relate these findings to the clinical features of COPD in a well-defined group of patients who have had extensive characterisation of their disease. In particular, researchers will relate this defect to the presence of frequent flares of disease, which lead to symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath. Comparison will be made between blood cells obtained from the lung and from he blood to determine if the alterations are specific to the lung.

Bacterial infections are of particular concern in patients with cirrhosis because they are poorly tolerated. Sepsis and associated endotoxaemia whereby bacteria produce inflammatory particles occur in approximately 40% of hospitalized patients with cirrhosis and is a major cause of death.||Gut-derived and blood-borne pathogens can induce an inflammatory response within the liver and spleen, which are the major organs that remove bacteria and their endotoxin (such as lipopolysaccharide - LPS and bacterial DNA itself) from the bloodstream. Several mechanisms have been identified and proposed in this process which depends upon a balance between the barrier functions of the gut and the 'detoxifying' capacity of the liver. People with established liver cirrhosis have been shown to have escape of endotoxin into the bloodstream produced by bacteria that reside in their intestines, which becomes more permeable or 'leaky'.||Gut dysfunction is defined by changes in the types of bacteria within the gut and in overall permeability allowing bacterial products which would otherwise be contained within the gut to travel into the bloodstream and lymphatic system with detrimental effects elsewhere in the body. This passage of bacterial products is termed bacterial translocation, and it's effects on the liver and general immune system can be then be measured.||It has now become recognised that certain types of white blood cells such as neutrophils and monocytes become dysfunctional and this predisposes to infection and may also have a more direct pathogenic role in hepatic encephalopathy. Thus neutrophil and monocytes may be a novel pharmacotherapeutic target in a condition where current therapies such as bowel aperients (e.g. lactulose) are inadequate. A therapeutic strategy utilising Rifaximin, a non-absorbable antibiotic, to modulate gut bacterial which produce ammonia, a chemical known to be important in the cause of hepatic encephalopathy, could potentially lower gut-derived systemic inflammation, endotoxaemia, infection and organ dysfunction in this population improving outcomes and prolonging transplant-free survival.||We therefore plan to test if Rifaximin positively affects markers of immune dysfunction in patients with liver cirrhosis experiencing chronic hepatic encephalopathy after 30 days of treatment, as our primary research question.||Positive results from this study would support further trials into the potential benefit of using Rifaximin to improve immune function, as well as reduce the recurrence of hepatic encephalopathy, in patients with liver cirrhosis.","Liver Cirrhosis|Hepatoencephalopathy, Early Fatal Progressive","No","Interventional","January 2015","October 2016","Rifaximin-α|Placebo Oral Tablet","Drug|Drug","Phase 4","All","75 Years","18 Years","Basic Science","Parallel Assignment","United Kingdom","Randomized","38",,

848,"Unknown status","Patients with obstructive jaundice (OJ) often require surgical, endoscopic or radiological interventions to facilitate biliary drainage and relieve jaundice. However it is known that patients with OJ have increased surgical risks than non-jaundiced patients undergoing the same procedures. Surgery for severe OJ is associated with a significant post-operative mortality (10-15%) and morbidity (30-65%). The commonest complications are related to sepsis but the pathophysiological mechanisms behind this susceptibility to bacterial infection are not clear. Recent work has shown a pivotal role of bile in the maintenance of enterocyte tight junctions and the expression of tight junction-associated proteins which could account for the translocation of enteric bacteria and bacterial products to mesenteric lymph node complexes, the portal circulation and subsequently the liver. Some of these bacterial products, such as endotoxin and quorum sensing signalling molecules (QSSMs), have immunomodulatory properties which may dampen normal immune responses to infection resulting in life-threatening organ dysfunction. Bacterial endotoxin and quorum sensing signalling molecules (QSSMs) represent good candidates for the mediators of this immune suppression and although there is a compelling case for their involvement in the pathogenesis of sepsis, evidence to support their involvement in the aetiology of infection in OJ is currently lacking.","Obstructive Jaundice|Disease as Reason for ERCP|Immune Dysfunction|Immune Tolerance","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","May 2011","December 2012",,,,"All","75 Years","18 Years",,,"United Kingdom",,"50",,

They are particularly linked to a change in the function of immune cells. In some patients, a state of pseudo-dormancy of monocyte and macrophage-type immune cells, called immunosuppression of myeloid cells, is observed. This situation leads to a worsening of the infection, so it should be avoided because it represents a danger for the patient even when they ar receiving antibiotics. At present, these events are still very poorly understood.

G-CSF is routinely given to patients with high risk neuroblastoma after chemotherapy to stimulate white blood cell production and shorten the time period when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), a type of white blood cell, is low after chemotherapy. G-CSF is known to shorten the period of low ANC by approximately 3 days.

Septic arthritis, which results from a bacterial infection in the joint, often requires a surgical procedure as well as a long course of antibiotics. In contrast, non-septic arthritis is typically treated by management of symptoms and observation. Current diagnostic standards involve microbiologic examination of fluid taken from the affected joint. This procedure can require the patient to be sedated, and the fluid culture analysis can take up to 72 hours. A single laboratory measure that could be easily obtained and quickly analyzed would aid in faster diagnosis, fewer diagnostic tests and lower cost of the diagnostic work-up for this condition.||Recent research on septic arthritis has identified procalcitonin as a potential septic arthritis diagnostic indicator. Procalcitonin (PCT) is secreted by cells in the thyroid at higher levels when the body is facing infection. Procalcitonin levels rise slowly over the first two hours and peak at 24 hours. Levels rise 100-fold in the peripheral blood stream during this time frame. Several studies have indicated PCT is promising potential diagnostic indicator for septic arthritis. Unfortunately, many of these studies have relatively small sample sizes and very few involve pediatric populations. Additional study of PCT and septic arthritis in children will help evaluate the viability of PCT as a diagnostic indicator.||Research Question:||Can serum procalcitonin assist in clinical differentiation between bacterial (septic) and non-bacterial arthritis?||Methods:||Patients presenting with possible septic arthritis in the emergency department will be recruited for this study.

The people most exposed to this virus remain the healthcare personnel who are on the front line in the fight against this pandemic. Due to the delayed nature of the pandemic in Reunion island and its insular geographical situation, the study of the voluntary medical personnel will allow the investigators to establish a longitudinal follow-up of the anomalies of the lipidic balance in relation to the exposure to the SARS-Cov virus. 2. During bacterial infections, the lipid profiles are profoundly modified with very significant reductions in plasma cholesterol levels, LDL-C but especially HDL-C whose concentrations are particularly low. Lipid profiles are altered during viral infections, for example, the severity of dengue is inversely correlated with total cholesterol and LDL-C but not with HDL-C levels, according to a recent meta-analysis. The hepatitis C virus circulates in serum linked to lipoproteins rich in triglycerides and HDL can facilitate its entry into cells via Scavenger receptor class B type 1 (SRB1). Likewise, it has been shown that apoA1 can bind to the dengue virus and increase its infectivity by promoting its entry into cells, also via SRB1. At the moment, nothing is known about the lipid profiles in subjects with SARS-CoV-2. The investigator hypothesize that a drop in plasma HDL-C levels and a change in their size during infection could justify future therapeutic approaches aimed at supplementing the subjects most at risk of pulmonary complications. In a model of Pseudomonas aeruginosa pneumonia in mice, investigators have shown that the injection of reconstituted HDL allowed to limit the pulmonary inflammation and the deleterious consequences of the infection.

867,"Recruiting","Immunotherapy has helped many cancer patients in the last 5 years by enhancing a patient's immune system to fight cancer. Anti-Programmed Death (PD-1) immunotherapy drugs such as pembrolizumab and nivolumab remove the breaks from cancer-fighting immune cells and have been effective in treating some melanoma patients. Despite the major breakthrough of immunotherapy in oncology treatment, many patients do not respond to this new class of anti-cancer drugs. Recently, evidence suggests that the microorganisms living in a patient's intestines play a major role in modifying the response to anti-PD-1drugs. Patients who respond to these drugs have a unique and healthy group of microorganisms in their gut. Therefore, positive modification of a cancer patient's gut microorganisms to create a more diverse and healthy microbiome may improve the response to immunotherapy. One method of modifying the microbiome is Fecal Microbial Transplantation (FMT) that is already being successfully used in the clinic to treat non-cancer patients with persistent bacterial infections.||In this study, the investigators will combine FMT with the approved immunotherapy drugs pembrolizumab or nivolumab that are the standard of care for the treatment of advanced melanoma. The purpose of this study is to examine the safety of combining these two therapies in melanoma patients.

868,"Completed","Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of the newborn, also called as hyaline membrane disease, is the most common cause of respiratory distress in premature infants, correlating with structural and functional lung immaturity. The pathophysiology of RDS is complex. Immature type II alveolar cells produce less surfactant that causes an increase in alveolar surface tension and a decrease in compliance. This resultant atelectasis lead to pulmonary vascular constriction, hypoperfusion, and lung tissue ischemia. RDS and prolonged ventilation and associated systemic/lung injury may also contribute to long term oxygen dependency and may result in bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hormone that primarily contributes to the maintenance of normal calcium homeostasis and skeletal mineralization. In addition to its classical role in bone metabolism, vitamin D deficiency has been associated with impaired pulmonary function, increased incidence of viral and bacterial infections and inflammatory lung diseases. Although exact mechanisms are not fully understood, vitamin D appears to impact on a variety of inflammatory and structural cells within the lung including macrophages, lymphocytes and epithelial cells. To our best of knowledge, no study has evaluated the effect of vitamin D levels on the severity and presence of RDS in preterm infants. Therefore, the aim of this study is to evaluate the possible role of maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels on RDS development in preterm infants. We also aim to determine the possible association between maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels and the incidence of BPD and other neonatal morbidities.","Vitamin D Deficiency","No","Observational","December 2012","December 2013",,,,"All","3 Days",,,,"Turkey",,"100",,

In contrast to other chronic diseases, COPD is increasing in prevalence and is projected to be the third-leading cause of death and disability worldwide by 2030. The costs to society for treating COPD are high, accounting for approximately 3.4% of the total health care budget of the European Union. Acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD) are responsible for a large portion of the economic burden of COPD. More than 500,000 hospitalisations and 100,000 deaths are attributed to AECOPD in the US each year. In addition to a substantial economic burden, AECOPD is also responsible for much of the morbidity and mortality from COPD.||Interleukin-33 (IL-33) is an alarmin released from the epithelium following damage. IL-33 is an IL-1 family alarmin cytokine constitutively expressed at epithelial barrier surfaces where it is rapidly released from cells during tissue injury. IL-33 signals through a receptor complex of IL-1 receptor-like 1 (IL1RL1) (known as ST2) and IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL1RAcP) to initiate MyD88-dependent inflammatory pathways. The role of the IL33/ST2 axis in COPD is uncertain. IL33 has been implicated in eosinophil recruitment to the airway and maturation in the bone marrow largely via its effects upon innate lymphoid cells. IL33 increased following experimental cold in asthma and thus might play a role in the consequent inflammatory response and possible susceptibility to secondary bacterial infection in obstructive lung disease. Both eosinophilic inflammation and viral infection drive COPD exacerbations and therefore targeting the IL33/ST2 axis might reduce COPD exacerbations.||The main aim of this trial is to evaluate whether anti-ST2 will impact on airway inflammation in COPD and therefore reduce the frequency of exacerbations. For the purposes of this trial, exacerbations are defined as flare-ups of symptoms involving the use of healthcare resulting in treatment with steroids and/or antibiotics and/or hospitalisation or death due to COPD.","COPD Exacerbation","No","Interventional","October 11, 2018","December 31, 2020","MSTT1041A|Placebo","Drug|Drug","Phase 2","All",,"40 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","United Kingdom","Randomized","81",,

Thus, after these different actions, the proportions of pneumococci with decreased susceptibility to penicillin G fell from 53 to 22%.||While there is a significant decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease in children since the use of conjugate vaccines (vaccination of up to 94% of children), the rate of invasive Pneumococcal disease in adults has decreased less significantly.||In March 2017, the High Council of Public Health (HCSP) proposed the vaccination of all non-immunocompromised adults at risk and immunocompromised patients.||Awareness-raising among vaccinating physicians seems essential, especially in recent years when the value of vaccination is threatened by speculation about its efficacy and toxicity. However, the investigators know that vaccination aims not only to protect the individual, but also the population, especially children and the elderly and the fragile people.||Thus, in the context of pneumococcal vaccination, identifying one or more profiles of patients at risk in the absence of vaccination could be particularly beneficial.

The reality of the bacterial infection remains controversial and the clinical presentation often leads to the prescription of empirical antibiotic therapy, often unnecessary in many cases. Number of antibiotic prescriptions are probably inappropriate.||Fever has long been recognized as a sign associated with pulmonary embolism. Stein et al reported a temperature above 37.5 ° C on 50% of patients with acute pulmonary embolism without actually clarified whether this was related to temperature with a pulmonary embolism or other associated cause. Murray et al estimated that greater than 38 ° C was explained by pulmonary embolism in 57.1% of patients while in the PIOPED study, only 14% of patients had fever with no other cause identified as pulmonary embolism. Fever due to pulmonary embolism is often low intensity (often less than 38.3) and of short duration, with a peak on the day of pulmonary embolism and a gradual decrease of about 1 week. The pathophysiology of fever in pulmonary embolism has not yet was completely clarified. It is suggested that a combination of several factors involved pyrogenic myocardial tissue necrosis and releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, hemorrhage, vascular irritation or inflammation, atelectasis or local superinfection.||Since 2004, the PCT has become a marker helping the initiation of antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.

To treat this they require medicines to keep their blood pressure high enough to get blood to their bodies. The side effects of these medicines include fast heart rates and increasing the amount of work the heart has to do. Corticosteroids are made by the body and help to use the energy in the food people eat, control the chemicals in their blood and maintain their blood pressure. Corticosteroids made by the body may be decreased in patients that have major surgery. Corticosteroids help to increase blood pressure and can decrease the amount of blood pressure medicines a patient requires. Corticosteroids have been shown to increase blood pressure in patients with bacterial infections and in very small, premature babies but have only been studied in a few babies who have had heart surgery.

It is a fairly common disease in hot, dry environments, representing as much as 3% of severe ophthalmic diseases and up to 33% of all eye pathology seen among young patients in eye clinics in Central Africa. Symptoms and signs can persist for years with an important visual morbidity and social impact. Corneal changes (e.g. corneal ulcers) can be sight threatening, occurring in up to 10% of VKC children. Topical steroid therapy remains the current standard treatment, but in developing countries its use often is chronic and not medically supervised, potentially leading to bacterial infections, steroid-induced glaucoma and cataract. Chromoglycate drops have less side effects but lack the power to control a flare-up. Topical cyclosporine has the potential to offer an efficient but safer alternative to steroid drops in the management of VKC in an African setting. Its safety and efficiency in the management of vernal keratoconjunctivitis have been described in several uncontrolled studies and double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, but those studies were relatively small and involved populations outside Africa with predominantly palpebral and mixed forms of VKC. Controversy still remains on the efficiency of cyclosporine in severe forms of allergic conjunctivitis like VKC. We therefore undertake a larger prospective randomized double-masked, standard treatment controlled clinical trial in Central Africa to compare the short-term efficiency of cyclosporine A (CsA) 2% eye drops, solved in olive oil vehicle, with that of steroid drops in predominantly limbal forms of VKC.

Ceftriaxone is a third generation cephalosporin with good CNS penetration, a long half-life, and was effective in both types of ALS assays. Ceftriaxone has calcium binding activity, antioxidant properties, and rescues motor neurons in culture from chronic glutamate toxicity.

Currently ceftriaxone is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treating bacterial infections but not for treating ALS.

The primary purpose of the algorithm is to prevent mortality due to bacterial pneumonia. However, an unknown proportion of children managed in this fashion will have a viral related wheezing illness or asthma rather than pneumonia. Although it is unlikely that wheezing syndromes are a significant cause of mortality for children in developing countries, these algorithms are likely to result in unnecessary administration of antibiotics as well as inadequate treatment of recurrent wheezing illness. We do not have clear evidence about whether antibiotics can be withheld in some categories of children with wheeze. It is clear that wheeze can occur in bacterial infection and in addition co-infection with virus and bacteria has been well demonstrated in several studies of pneumonia etiology in children.

The potential role of platelets and platelet activation in this process is unclear. Platelets participate in inflammation by secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators which may advance hepatic fibrosis. Hepatitis B virus transgenic mice, developed significantly smaller necroinflammatory foci and their serum ALT levels were 80% lower, if they were pre-treated with anti-platelet antibodies. Sinusoidal aggregation of activated platelets also occurs in chronic hepatitis C in humans. It may contribute to thrombocytopenia observed in CLD. Platelet activation is generally believed to be compromised in CLD. However, there is data suggesting that CLD may even be associated with an enhancement of platelet activation. Measurement of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) constitutes the most common method for estimation of portal venous pressure. HVPG is significantly correlated with histological indices of CLD progression.||Study hypotheses:||HVPG as a marker for advancement of hepatic fibrosis and progression of CLD is associated with an increase in platelet activation.|Platelet activation and function is not generally compromised in CLD. Comparison of platelet function in CLD to a control group of healthy volunteers is intended to clarify whether CLD leads to a manifest platelet dysfunction||Methods: Study design is observational. 100 patients with CLD of various origins (viral, alcoholic, cholestatic) scheduled for routine HVPG measurement will be enrolled. 30 healthy volunteers will donate blood as a control group. Platelet function and activation will be evaluated by multiple electrode aggregometry (primary outcome variable area under the curve (AUC). Plasma levels of P-selectin (ELISA), PFA (Platelet Function Analyzer) 100™ parameters (EPI-CT and ADP-CT), percentage of P-selectin, GPIIb/IIIa, thrombin receptor positive platelets after stimulation (flow-cytometry) will constitute secondary outcome parameters. Plasmatic coagulation will be evaluated by rotational thrombelastometry (ROTEM). Platelet count and routine coagulation parameters will be monitored. HVPG measurement by hepatic vein catheterization and patient blood sampling will be carried out via the internal jugular vein. Blood sampling in volunteers will be performed via the antecubital vein||Study Rationale: If higher levels of platelet activation are associated with increased HVPGs, this would provide an insight into the pathogenesis of CLD. It would also point toward a possible benefit of anti-platelet therapy in CLD. Verification of platelet dysfunction in CLD is relevant to clinical practice in anaesthesiology and intensive care as procedures are often postponed in CLD-patients for fear of bleeding complications.

Accordingly, a significant number of individuals will develop persisting post-COVID symptoms, while many of them will report on lasting fatigue. The main objective of the current study is to assess risk factors for the development of post-COVID-19 fatigue symptoms. As a secondary aim, the current study is intended to identify pathophysiology and explanatory mechanisms for the post-COVID-19 fatigue.||Study design and population: a nested case-control study will be conducted at Rabin Medical Center (RMC), Beilinson Hospital. RMC runs a post-COVID-19 clinic for adult (age ≥18 years) recovered individuals (diagnosed using a polymerase chain reaction test from a nasopharyngeal sample), who are invited for a comprehensive medical evaluation. During a visit, all individuals undergo pulmonary function testing and an evaluation by an infectious diseases physician, a pulmonologist, and a social worker. The cohort of recovered COVID-19 individuals evaluated at RMC will serve as the population from which the current study participants will be consecutively sampled. The cases would be defined as such if report on lasting fatigue symptoms which appeared following COVID-19, while at least two months have elapsed since COVID-19 diagnosis and the lasting fatigue symptoms are present for at least six weeks. The controls would be defined as those that did not report on fatigue symptoms at any time point since one month following their diagnosis with COVID-19.||Evaluation protocol of cases and controls: All participating individuals (cases and controls) will be assessed following the study protocol. The assessment will be conducted as follows:||First assessment meeting (approximately one hour long) in which the participant will undergo physical examination and blood tests, fill the study questionnaires [demographic, clinical and post-COVID fatigue questionnaire; sleep assessment questionnaires (Epworth sleepiness score [ESS], Pittsburg sleep quality index [PSQI], Insomnia severity index (ISI)]) and depression severity questionnaire (the patient health questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9]), and conduct cognitive fatigue task.||Second assessment meeting: (approximately one hour long) in which the participants will undergo a cardiopulmonary stress test (CPET).||Data collection: The main dependent variable will be the presence of continuing fatigue symptoms. The independent variables included demographic and clinical characteristics. The demographic variables will include: age at diagnosis, sex, marital status and number of children, occupational status (employed, unemployed, or retired), education (number of years at school and higher education), and occupation. The clinical variables will include: smoking status, alcohol and cannabis consumption, basic physical function (independent, limited in certain activities, dependent in activities of daily living, or bedridden), background illnesses, and pharmacotherapy. The acute COVID-19 history will be also collected: disease severity according to the WHO criteria, symptoms (sore throat, nasal congestion, headache anosmia/disguesia, cough, shortness of breath, chest pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, and myalgia), need for hospitalization, hospital complications (veno-thromboembolism, super-imposed bacterial infections), for individuals who were not hospitalized - the site of isolation (home, hotel or another isolation facility) will be collected, time from onset to symptoms resolution, pharmacotherapy directed at COVID-19, and information of other household or family members who were also diagnosed.||Statistical methods: Demographic and clinical variables of the patients with fatigue symptoms (cases) and control group (free from fatigue symptoms) will be compared using bivariate and multivariable conditional logistic regression models. Independent variables will be selected to be included in the multivariable model based on the bivariate analysis. Odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals will be obtained from the conditional logistic regression models. P<0.05 will be considered statistically significant.||Sample size calculation: Disease severity may serve as a potential risk factor for the development of lasting fatigue symptoms. A preliminary analysis revealed that in our cohort of recovered COVID-19 patients, 20% were hospitalized due to their disease's severity. We will therefore assume that the proportions of individuals required hospitalization during the acute phase were 30% and 10% of the cases and controls, respectively. It is also likely that approximately two thirds of our sample would report on persisting fatigue. Under these assumptions, a sample size of 153 individuals (102 in the cases group and 51 in the control group) will yield a statistical power of 80% at a significance level of 5% for detecting a difference of 0.2 between two proportions.","Covid19|Post-COVID / Long-COVID","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","March 2, 2021","August 24, 2021","Cardiopulmonary stress test (CPET)","Diagnostic Test",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Israel",,"144",,

Definitions and descriptions of ACLF vary between Western and Eastern types, and alcoholism and hepatitis B virus (HBV) are the main etiologies, respectively. To determine whether there are unified diagnostic criteria, severity classification and prognostic model for different etiologies of ACLF. Investigators had launched a multicenter prospective cohort with the same inclusion criteria and disease indicators as those used in the European CANONIC (Chronic liver failure-ACLF in Cirrhosis) study in China，the Ch-CANONIC study(NCT02457637). From Jan 2015 to Dec 2016, 2,600 inpatients with chronic liver disease complicated with ALI and/or AD were recruited. Data were collected during a 28-day hospitalization and continuous follow-ups were performed once a month until 36 months after hospitalization (at least 18 months up to now). Of these patients, 71.5% had HBV-related disease, 1833 had cirrhotic disease, and 767 had non-cirrhotic disease diagnosed by CT scan.||Due to the lack of pathological gold standards, the diagnosis of ACLF is based on the clinical assessment of short-term mortality from organ functional parameters. In subsequent statistics and data analysis, investigators focused on (but not limit in) the relationship between short-term mortality and 6 parameters (bilirubin, INR, Creatinine, SpO2/FiO2, mean arterial pressure and West-Haven grade) from CLIF-C OFs (Chronic liver failure-Consortium Organ Failure score). And then a specific mathematical model has been constructed to obtain the available organ failure cutoff values. Subsequently, investigators carried out a diagnostical criteria for ACLF based on the results obtained from the model and get a good internal-validation result through risk ratio. Meanwhile, investigators conducted a precise prediction model for patients' prognosis and achieved a good predictive effect with consistency by AUC internal-validation. In addition, investigators summarized the course and some characteristics of ACLF.||Therefore, investigators hope to launch another prospective multi-center cohort study with the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, and continue to recruit 800 to 900 patients (about 30% of the previous cohort) as the external validation cohort for the preliminary results mentioned above.","Liver Failure, Acute on Chronic|Liver Dysfunction","No","Observational","September 20, 2018","July 31, 2020","Standary therapy","Other",,"All","79 Years","15 Years",,,"China|China|China|China|China|China|China|China|China|China|China|China",,"1370",,

929,"Active, not recruiting","Infections of the blood are extremely serious and require intravenous antibiotic treatment. When the infection results from antibiotic resistant bacteria, the choice of antibiotic is an extremely important decision. Some types of bacteria produce enzymes that may inactivate essential antibiotics, related to penicillin, called 'beta-lactams'. Furthermore high level production of these enzymes can occur during therapy and lead to clinical failure, even when an antibiotic appears effective by laboratory testing. However, this risk of this occurring in clinical practice has only been well described in a limited range of antibiotic classes in a type of bacteria called Enterobacter. There is currently uncertainty as to whether a commonly used, and highly effective antibiotic, called piperacillin-tazobactam is subject to the same risk of resistance developing while on treatment. Infections caused by Enterobacter (and other bacteria with similar resistance mechanisms) are often treated with an alternative drug called meropenem (a carbapenem antibiotic), which is effective but has an extremely broad-spectrum of activity. Excessive use of carbapenems is driving further resistance to this antibiotic class - which represent our 'lastline' of antibiotic defence. As such, we need studies to help us see whether alternatives to meropenem are an effective and safe choice. No study has ever directly tested whether these two antibiotics have the same effectiveness for this type of infection. The purpose of this study is to randomly assign patients with blood infection caused by Enterobacter or related bacteria to either meropenem or piperacillin/tazobactam in order to test whether these antibiotics have similar effectiveness.","Bloodstream Infections","No","Interventional","April 2015","December 2020","Meropenem|Piperacillin-tazobactam combination product","Drug|Drug","Phase 4","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Australia|Australia|Australia|Australia|Singapore|Singapore","Randomized","100",,

The investigators face a situation where a commonly used antibiotic for these infections (meropenem) may be driving carbapenem resistance. For this reason, the investigators are seeking to compare a carbapenem-sparing regimen with a carbapenem for the treatment of these infections. Formal evaluation of safety and efficacy of generic antibiotics in the treatment of infection is of immense clinical and public health importance, and no formal trial has yet been conducted to address these issues.

The newly emerged Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), which was first identified in Wuhan, China, has swept through 219 countries, killing a staggering number of people. According to WHO reports, the number of deaths had risen to 3,155,168by March 30, 2021, out of 149,910,744 confirmed cases. In Bangladesh, the outbreak has infected over 745,322confirmed cases, with over 11,053 deaths reported. Though the patient may be asymptomatic or present with mild symptoms, mortality is quite high in the severe form of the disease which often progresses to critical phase presented as Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). This is due to exaggerated response of immune system to the virus termed as cytokine storm syndrome (CSS). There is currently no effective antiviral therapy for SARS-CoV-2 and supportive care is the mainstay of therapy. As a result we are still searching for a better therapeutic agent which will help in treating Covid-19 cases in terms of mortality, morbidity, oxygen requirement, length of stay in hospital. Co-trimoxazole (composed of one-part Trimethoprim and five parts Sulfamethoxazole)is a sulphur containing anti-folate bactericidal drug which is being used for over 60 years for various indications esp. respiratory tract infections. It is known to have immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory properties that may help to prevent progression to critical phase and cytokine storm syndrome in severe COVID-19 patients. It acts rapidly when given in high dose due to its better bioavailability and lung penetration. Low cost and a good safety profile can make it an ideal candidate for treatment of COVID -19 in a low resource country like Bangladesh.||Methods and materials:||This interventional double-blind place controlled randomized trial will be conducted in the department of medicine at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University (BSMMU) for a duration of 6 months following approval of this protocol.

These methods include suppressive antibiotics, estrogen cream, methenamine hippurate, d-mannose, cranberry, probiotics, and vitamin C. Of these, the majority of the literature is in favor of use of suppressive antibiotics for preventing UTIs. However, this data is now about 10 years old. Increasing use of antibiotics over the years has lead to increased resistance of bacteria. In addition, long-term antibiotic use has several adverse effects, some life-threatening. There is recent literature evaluating the use of several of the alternatives to suppressive antibiotics with mixed results. A comparative study of the efficacy of methenamine hippurate to suppressive antibiotics is lacking in the current literature. Several early partly-randomized trials done with methenamine hippurate have shown promising results, but are only as recent as 1987.

The fulminant course of NSTIs demands immediate diagnosis and adequate interventions in order to salvage lives and limbs. However, diagnosis and management are difficult due to heterogeneity in clinical presentation, in co-morbidities and in microbiological aetiology. Thus, there is an urgent need for novel diagnostics and therapeutics in order to improve outcome of NSTIs. A comprehensive knowledge of diagnostic features, causative microbial agent, treatment strategies, and pathogenic mechanisms (host and bacterial disease traits and their underlying interaction network) is required for an improved diagnosis and management of NSTIs. The current proposal is designed to obtain such insights through an integrated systems biology approach in patients and experimental models. The project is based on a prospective NSTI patients cohort including a clinical registry to document clinical data and treatment strategies, combined with an isolate and biobank collection. The samples will be analyzed through advanced bioinformatics and computational modelling work flow to identify and quantify pathogen signatures and underlying networks that contribute to disease outcome.

Post-infectious GAS sequelae of GAS include acute rheumatic fever (ARF, ~500,000 incident cases) leading to rheumatic heart disease (RHD, ~34 million prevalent cases), and acute glomerulonephritis.

964,"Recruiting","The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way is perfect for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease: antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding bacteria or substances, which stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or cells that are infected with bacteria or viruses. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to treat cancer. This study will combine both T cells and antibodies in order to create a more effective treatment called Autologous T Lymphocyte Chimeric Antigen Receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen (ATLCAR.CD30). Another treatment being tested includes the Autologous T Lymphocyte Chimeric Antigen Receptor cells targeted against the CD30 antigen with CCR4 (ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4) to help the cells move to regions in the patient's body where the cancer is present. Participants in this study will receive either ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells alone or will receive ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells combined with ATLCAR.CD30 cells.||Previous studies have shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. The new gene that is put in the T cells in this study makes an antibody called anti-CD30. This antibody sticks to lymphoma cells because of a substance on the outside of the cells called CD30. Anti-CD30 antibodies have been used to treat people with lymphoma but have not been strong enough to cure most patients. For this study, the anti-CD30 antibody has been changed so instead of floating free in the blood it is now joined to the T cells. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric receptor. These CD30 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells (ATLCAR.CD30) can kill some of the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the cancer are unknown.||Researchers are working to identify ways to improve the ability of ATLCAR.CD30 to destroy tumor cells. T cells naturally produce a protein called CCR4 which functions as a navigation system directing T cells toward tumor cells specifically. In this study, researchers will also genetically modify ATLCAR.CD30 cells to produce more CCR4 proteins and they will be called ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4. The study team believes that the ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 cells will be guided directly toward the tumor cells based on their navigation system. In addition, the study team believes the majority of ATLCAR.CD30 cells will also be guided directly toward tumor cells when given together with ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4, increasing their anti-cancer fighting ability.||This is the first time ATLCAR>CD30.CCR4 cells or combination of ATLCAR.CD30.CCR4 and ATLCAR.CD30 cells are used to treat lymphoma.

Official records indicate that, in Colombia, the first case was diagnosed on March 6, 2020, corresponding to a patient from Italy. However, in conversations with several infectologists and intensivists from Medellín, it was agreed that clinical cases similar to the clinical presentation that is now recognized as COVID-19 had arisen since the end of 2019 when it was still unknown to everyone. The previous suggests that the virus was already circulating in the country since before March 6, 2020. But at that moment, there were no tools to make a clinical identification, nor to diagnose it from the laboratory's point of view.||Considering as real the hypothesis that the infection has been circulating in the country since before the first official diagnosis, the question arises: Why does not the country still has the same healthcare and humanitarian chaos that countries such as Italy and Spain are suffering at this time? To answer this question may be that there are differences in vaccination rates with BCG (Bacille Calmette-Guérin or tuberculosis vaccine), which is significantly higher in Latin America compared to those in Europe.

However, a causal relationship between the oral microbiome and liver disease and outcomes is a matter of conjecture. Oral bacterial diseases, such as caries and periodontitis are caused by a consortium of bacteria rather than a single species. These constitute opportunistic infections that occur under the proper circumstances and conditions, e.g., diet, host immune response, complicating systemic or genetic disorders, pH, poor oral hygiene and lifestyle. It is well known that specific bacterial taxa that colonize the oral cavity are associated with oral health and oral diseases or afflictions, such as dental caries, periodontal diseases, endodontic lesions, dry socket, halitosis, and odontogenic infections.||Bajaj et al have demonstrated systematic periodontal therapy in cirrhotic outpatients improved endotoxemia, as well as systemic and local inflammation, and modulated salivary and stool microbial dysbiosis over 30 days. Bajaj et al performed another study on comparison of oral and gut microbiota in patients with and without hepatic encephalopathy.||There were differences in salivary microbiota composition and inflammatory markers between controls and cirrhotics.

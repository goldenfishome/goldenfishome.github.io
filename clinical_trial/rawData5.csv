Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE) was first found in 1988 and has become an important healthcare-associated pathogen due to rapid spread, limited options for therapy and the possibility of transferring vancomycin resistance to more virulent pathogens. VRE infections not only contribute to more hospital cost and longer length of hospital stay, but also higher attributable mortality compared to those caused by vancomycin susceptible enterococci. Two different meta-analyses have shown that vancomycin resistance is an independent predictor of death among patients with enterococcal bloodstrem infections (BSIs). Despite this, few effective antibiotics are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of serious VRE infections. Though several studies have conducted to find the possible mortality predictors, but none has used bacterial load as a marker.||Schonheyder et al. have used semiquantitative culture, and demonstrate the relationship between high bacterial load and mortality.

Pneumocystis infection in people with weakened immunity especially patients with HIV infection or cancer, organ transplant recipients and people receiving immune suppressing therapy can cause life-threatening pneumonia. Currently, pneumocystis infection is diagnosed by sputum analysis or bronchoalveolar lavage. For the sputum analysis, patients are induced to produce a sputum sample (liquid discharge from the lung) using a saline mist; however, many hospitals lack the expertise to perform this procedure. The second method, bronchoalveolar lavage, involves inserting a flexible tube into the lung and injecting saline to produce a specimen for diagnosis. This method, however, is time-consuming and can be uncomfortable. New techniques may allow the use of an oral wash to diagnose pneumocystis, even though an oral sample contains far fewer organisms than are obtained with the current methods. This study will examine whether new techniques, such as nucleic acid amplification, may enable a simple oral wash to be used effectively for diagnosis of pneumocystis infection.||Patients 3 years of age and older with weakened immunity who have acute pneumonia may be eligible for this study. In addition, people at increased risk of infection with pneumocystis, including health care professionals, family members of patients, and other patients in health care facilities, may participate.||Participants will have a medical history and review of medical records to determine their health status and determine if they have had recent respiratory problems or documented PCP. They will then provide an oral wash sample. For this procedure, subjects first rinse their mouth well. Then, they vigorously swish 50 milliliters of saline for 5 to 10 seconds and immediately repeat the procedure to provide two specimens. Washes may be requested daily, weekly, monthly, or for a period of time to be specified. Participants will also have two tubes of blood drawn (total of 20 milliliters, or 4 teaspoons) to test for evidence of pneumocystis.||Although no other tests are required for this protocol, participants may be asked to provide optional add'l samples, as follows:||If a sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage sample is required in the course of the patient s clinical mgmt, enough material will be obtained, if possible, for research purposes as well as what is needed for routine care.||An induced sputum sample may be requested just for this protocol.

It can cause many different symptoms including rash, fever, headache, meningitis (infection of the central nervous system), and arthritis. While most patients improve after taking antibiotics, some patients continue to have symptoms. It is currently unknown why some patients continue to have symptoms. One possibility is that the antibiotics have not successfully gotten rid of all of the bacteria. Current tests for Lyme disease cannot tell whether the bacteria have been successfully eliminated from the body.||Xenodiagnosis is a way to look for Borrelia bacteria using the animal that usually hosts them, Ixodes scapularis (also known as the deer tick). This method takes advantage of the evolution of the bacteria and the insect that transmits the infection, which can make the insect particularly good at finding the agent. In studies of animals, xenodiagnosis may be more sensitive than current tests for detecting the presence of the Lyme disease bacteria. Researchers are interested in using xenodiagnosis to determine whether uninfected ticks that feed on humans who have been infected with Lyme disease bacteria can detect the continued presence of live bacteria.||Objectives:||- To determine whether xenodiagnosis can be used to successfully investigate the presence of Lyme disease bacteria.||Eligibility:||Individuals at least 18 years of age who are in one of the following categories:|Have had the erythema migrans rash (a symptom of Lyme infection) and received antibiotic therapy less than 4 months ago (but have not had antibiotics in the previous month).|Have the erythema migrans rash and received less than 2 days of antibiotic therapy.|Have been diagnosed with early or late Lyme disease, have received antibiotic therapy, but still have high levels of antibodies against the bacteria at least 6 months after therapy, and have not received antibiotics in the past 3 months.|Have been diagnosed with early or late Lyme disease, have received antibiotic therapy, and have new complaints of fatigue or other symptoms that are persistent for at least 6 months after completion of antibiotic therapy, and have not received antibiotics in the past 3 months.|Have been diagnosed with Lyme arthritis and have not yet received antibiotic therapy.|Healthy volunteers who have not had Lyme disease will also be included in this study.||Design:||Participants will have an initial visit for a physical examination, medical history, and blood sample.|For the first study visit, researchers will place a strip of filter paper or a small plastic container with 20 to 30 disease-free ticks on the participant s skin.

CDC guidelines support the use of EPT for partner management with heterosexual patients, but note the absence of evidence necessary to make an equivalent recommendation for the use of EPT with MSM. Randomized clinical trials to assess the impact of EPT on partner notification, treatment, and STI re-infection among MSM are critical to the development of evidence-based partner management guidelines.||As a theoretical model, EPT integrates behavioral, social, and biomedical approaches to HIV/STI control in a comprehensive prevention intervention.

Project Aware will scaffold routine, rapid testing and counseling for Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) and Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GC) onto an existing, successful, ED-based HIV testing and counseling program, Project BRIEF. Project Aware will educate and motivate youth to use condoms with the aid of a theory-based, youth-friendly multimedia behavioral intervention proven to be effective during the investigator's K23 training. Through Project Aware, the investigators propose to change the paradigm of STI testing. Whereas a view of ""HIV exceptionalism"" has persisted in U.S. health policies on STI testing, the investigators propose a comprehensive approach, in which efforts to identify, treat, and prevent multiple STIs coalesce in one program. The research study has two phases. In the production phase, new STI material will be added to the multimedia intervention currently used for HIV education. In the evaluation phase, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to assess the effectiveness of Project Aware in identifying, treating, and preventing new STI infections among high-risk adolescents. The RCT is designed to test the incremental effectiveness of three STI prevention methods: (1) HIV testing and counseling (T&C), (2) HIV T&C and STI testing, and (3) HIV/STI Testing plus a point-of-service risk reduction video that incorporates both HIV and STI counseling and education. The study is powered to examine three STI prevention outcomes: (1) the number of STI infections identified and treated successfully at baseline; (2) the number of new STI infections over the 12 months following study entry, identified by (a) performing STI testing at each follow-up assessment; and (b) obtaining anonymized rate data on STIs reported to the New York City Department of Health; (3) condom use behavior. 600 youth aged 14-21 will be enrolled in the RCT. Youth will be approached in the ED waiting room and recruited by Public Health Advocates.

This high rate of recurrence, together with the absence of response to all conventionally used antibiotic treatments, has important repercussions in the morbidity and mortality of patients, in the ecology of the hospital due to the risk of transmission of a strain of major severity and in the high costs associated with an increase in the hospitalization days of these patients, as well as in an eventual transfer of these to other structures specialized in fecal transplantation.||Two hypotheses are proposed to explain the higher frequency reported:||Hypothesis 1.

4045,"Completed","The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) as one of the nation's top three urgent AMR threats. Since the advent of antibiotics in the 1930s, NG has developed resistance to every first-line antibiotic. Parenteral third-generation cephalosporins are now the only class of drug with consistent efficacy against NG. New therapies are urgently needed. Although some novel antimicrobials are under development, reevaluating older drugs is another option for quickly identifying additional treatments for gonorrhea. We propose a demonstration study to test a single dose of aztreonam for the treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea. We chose to focus on pharyngeal gonorrhea because these infections are common, play an important role in fostering gonococcal resistance, and are harder to eradicate than genital infections. Although aztreonam appears to be >98.6% efficacious for anogenital NG, its efficacy at the pharynx may be less. Only 8 cases of pharyngeal gonorrhea have been documented to be treated with aztreonam, but of those, only 5 (62.5%) were cured. The dose used in those studies was 1g of aztreonam. Most antibiotics have a lower efficacy at the pharynx than anogenital sites, which is likely due to drug pharmacokinetics, i.e. difficulty in penetrating pharyngeal tissue. Thus, in the proposed study, we plan to treat 50 subjects with untreated pharyngeal gonorrhea with 2g IM Aztreonam.||Objectives:||The proposed study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a single 2g intramuscular (IM) dose of aztreonam in the treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea. Secondary objectives include documenting the efficacy stratified by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared with the previously document area under the curve (AUC) in order to estimate a pharmacodynamic criterion. We will also attempt to determine whether aztreonam monotherapy induces antimicrobial resistance among treatment failures. Lastly, we will evaluate the tolerability of 2g of IM aztreonam. The specific aims are:||Determine the proportion of persons whose pharyngeal gonococcal infections are cured with a single dose of 2g aztreonam intramuscularly.|Determine the proportion of persons with urethral and/or rectal gonorrhea whose infections are cured with a single dose of 2g aztreonam IM.|Evaluate the tolerability of 2g IM of aztreonam .|Estimate the best pharmacodynamics criterion (i.e. AUC/MIC ratio) for pharyngeal gonorrhea treated with aztreonam using previously published AUC for 2g aztreonam and NG isolate MIC.|Among treatment failures, conduct exploratory analyses comparing pre- and post-treatment MIC for evidence of induced resistance.||Study Design: Prospective cohort||Study Population & Inclusion Criteria:||Persons diagnosed with pharyngeal gonorrhea or gonococcal urethritis who are undergoing pharyngeal gonorrhea testing, who are not yet treated.||Intervention: 2g IM aztreonam x 1||Primary Outcome: Negative gonorrhea culture 4-7 days (+/- 1 day) after treatment||Sample Size: 50 persons","Gonorrhea of Pharynx|Gonorrhea","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","April 5, 2019","September 30, 2019","Aztreonam","Drug","Phase 2|Phase 3","All",,"16 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","United States","N/A","32",,

Most active cases occur in migrants due to reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI) acquired abroad. Screening migrants for LTBI was recently introduced by Public Health England to reduce TB rates and transmission of infectious cases. Newham, which has one of the highest TB rates in London introduced the first large-scale LTBI screening programme for migrants, but it is poorly accessed by pregnant women and screening uptake is low. The issue of how best to screen for TB during pregnancy is important because pregnant/ postpartum women are at particularly high risk of developing TB, and migrants from countries with high TB rates may only interact with healthcare services during pregnancy.||Effective strategies are urgently needed to improve screening uptake for LTBI in pregnant migrants. The Antenatal clinic is an attractive location to screen for LTBI because uptake and acceptability of opt-out screening for other infectious diseases (HIV) is high. We will evaluate the uptake, effectiveness and acceptability of routine screening for LTBI in antenatal clinics. Eligible patients are pregnant women who have entered the UK within 10 years from a country with TB rates of >150/100,000.

Optimal treatment requires the resection of the infected total joint arthroplasty followed by prolonged parenteral antimicrobial therapy. This procedure is followed by reimplantation of a new total joint arthroplasty at a later date. Surgical debridement and retention of the infected total joint arthroplasty offers a more conservative surgical approach and has been proven to be cost-effective in selected groups of patients. Traditional medical therapy for staphylococcal infection would require an initial parenteral antimicrobial followed by chronic oral non-rifampin containing antimicrobial suppression regimen for the life of the total joint arthroplasty.

Although reasons for this include reduced physical activity owing to unfixed working hours, lack of sleep or disturbances in the circadian rhythm may also be related to the occurrences of type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome. The mechanism may be due to sleep deprivation induced activation of the hypothalamic- pituitary- adrenal axis (HPA axis) that affects blood glucose metabolism. The gut brain axis might adjust the HPA axis via the bottom-up pathway through vagus nerve, the neuroendocrine system, or the immune system. It is also possible that physiological or psychological stressors might influence intestinal function through the top-down pathways. Associations between microbiota and many chronic diseases, including metabolic syndrome, diabetes, obesity, neurodegenerative diseases, or mental diseases have been investigated in recent years.

This antibiotic was developed in the 1960s and preliminary pharmacokinetic studies were performed at that time. Dosing recommendations, on the basis of these pharmacokinetic studies, are listed in the drug's product information. However, there are no dosing recommendations for patients requiring renal replacement therapy (either intermittent hemodialysis or continuous venovenous hemofiltration). Furthermore, the science of antibiotic dosing (""pharmacodynamics"") has changed significantly since the 1960s and it is quite possible that the dosing recommendations listed in the product information are not optimal. Furthermore, even though physicians refer to ""colistin"" administration, the only intravenous form of the drug is colistin methanesulfonate (CMS). CMS is converted in the body to colistin. Both CMS and colistin have different pharmacokinetic and antimicrobial activities. For this reason, we, the investigators at the University of Pittsburgh, are performing a pilot study of the pharmacokinetics of intravenous CMS/colistin in patients requiring this antibiotic for clinical purposes. Plasma concentrations will be determined around a CMS/colistin dose once the drug has reached steady state. Concentrations in pulmonary epithelial lining fluid will also be determined in patients with pneumonia. Microbiologic and clinical endpoints will be determined and will be correlated with these concentrations. The measurement of CMS and colistin levels will be determined by a laboratory in Australia which developed these assays. A submission is being made to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for funding of a multicenter study which will address this research question with a greater sample size.

The study aims to identify factors that drive progression to disease and study signals (markers of the immune response) that detect who will progress to active TB and why this happens. Armed with these markers, the study will address how malnutrition and worms alter this signal profile to cause active TB. The work will be conducted in India, where there are 2.8 million TB cases each year - more than any other country - and where the government has committed to eliminating TB by 2035. Data suggest that malnutrition and parasites increase risk of TB disease so the investigators will feed malnourished household contacts and have those with parasites receive medication to treat these. Using this infrastructure, the investigators will evaluate the immunologic impact of feeding on TB pathogenesis. An additional aim is to understand the role of parasitic worms with the goal of determining the utility of low-cost ($.02 per dose) worm treatment as part of TB control efforts.

The disease course may be complicated by fulminant disease requiring removal of the colon or by multiple recurrences requiring re-hospitalization. The incidence and severity of Clostridium difficile infection is rising, and it poses an increasing burden on the health system. For example, in one of our previous studies we found that 804 in-patients and 568 out-patients had a positive test for Clostridium difficile toxin at Beaumont Laboratories in 2003. The standard treatment is a 2 week course of Vancomycin or Metronidazole. The clinical response to Metronidazole appears to be declining, and many practicing clinicians prefer Vancomycin as a first-line treatment. The recurrence rate after the treatment is similar for Vancomycin and Metronidazole and is usually in the range of 15-25%, although recent reports noted a recurrence rate up to 50% during outbreaks with a virulent strain. Recently, it has been suggested that a 2 week duration of treatment might not be adequate in clearing the infection.||Our HYPOTHESIS is that a prolongation of Vancomycin treatment from 2 weeks to 4 weeks will lead to a decrease rate of recurrent Clostridium Difficile colitis.","Clostridium Difficile Colitis","No","Interventional","February 2009","January 2010","Standard Vancomycin|Extended Vancomycin","Drug|Drug","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","United States","Randomized","0",,

It is caused by a bacteria that enters through the lungs and can spread elsewhere in the body. People with latent TB have the bacteria that lie dormant but can become active and cause disease. These people are offered treatment to prevent development of active TB. Worldwide, a lot of people with LTBI also have a parasitic worm called a helminth that can stay in the gut or the blood. These parasites can affect the immune system and cause diseases like TB to become worse. Researchers want to see how helminth infection makes it harder for people to fight TB infection.||Objectives:||- To study how the immune system of people with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) acts to prevent development of active TB.

4096,"Recruiting","Tuberculosis meningitis (TBM) is the most severe manifestation of TB, resulting in death or neurological disability in up to 50% of affected patients, despite antibacterial treatment. This TBM treatment follows the model for pulmonary TB by using the same first-line TB drugs (a combination of rifampicin, isoniazid, pyrazinamide and ethambutol) and the same dosing guidelines, although it is known that penetration of two of these drugs (rifampicin and ethambutol) into cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is limited. Improvement of treatment of TBM is urgently needed.||To do so, a combination of two interventions will be investigated in this study. A series of phase II clinical trials on higher doses of the pivotal TB drug rifampicin in Indonesian patients with TBM have shown that the dose of rifampicin can be increased from 10 mg/kg orally (standard dose) up to 30 mg/kg orally, resulting in a strong increase in exposure to this drug in plasma and CSF, no increase in grade III or IV adverse effects, and a reduction in mortality. Similarly, higher doses of rifampicin up to 35 mg/kg resulted in strong increases in plasma concentrations; the doses were well tolerated and reduced time to sputum conversion in African pulmonary TB patients.||Next to a higher dose of rifampicin, the approved antibacterial drug linezolid seems a good candidate for a new TBM regimen. The drug penetrates well into the CSF and is applied successfully against other central nervous system (CNS) infections (e.g. caused by penicillin-nonsusceptible Streptococcus pneumoniae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus). In a study in China, linezolid in a dose of 600 mg BID orally strongly increased recovery of patients with TBM response. Linezolid is also being investigated as a new drug for (drug-resistant) pulmonary TB in numerous studies, in a dose of 1200 mg once daily. More severe adverse effects to this drug typically occur only after prolonged treatment during several months, not during short-term treatment.||Overall, linezolid is expected to be a promising and tolerable candidate for a new intensified TBM treatment regimen consisting of a backbone of high dose rifampicin plus linezolid.","Tuberculosis, Meningeal|Linezolid","No","Interventional","April 21, 2021","July 2023","Linezolid","Drug","Phase 2","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Indonesia","Randomized","36",,

The unit of randomization is the health facility (24 health facilities randomized). The trial tests a complex intervention-a two phase programmatic public health package which includes a standardized public health evaluation and analysis, to identify problems and barriers limiting Latent Tuberculosis Infection diagnosis and treatment among close contacts of active Tuberculosis cases. This will be followed by implementation of appropriate solutions and strengthening of the LTBI clinical program. The primary objective will be to estimate the increase the number of household contacts initiating LTBI treatment per newly diagnosed index patient, within 3 months of diagnosis of the index patient. A secondary objective is to evaluate the cost effectiveness of this two phase intervention. If successful, this approach can be expanded throughout these countries. After initial preparations, including administrative and ethical review, all participating sites will be randomized to intervention or control. Immediately after this, Phase 1 will begin in intervention sites with the standardized public health evaluation to identify barriers to LTBI diagnosis and treatment initiation and the selection of solutions to be used in Phase 2. To ensure standardization of data gathering research staff will use (i) current indicators of the Latent Tuberculosis Infection cascade of care in intervention facilities (number of contacts per index case registered, investigated, started on treatment and completing treatment) and (ii) interviewer administered questionnaires for patients with active pulmonary Tuberculosis, adult and child household contacts and clinic staff. These questionnaires will assess latent Tuberculosis-related knowledge, attitudes and beliefs from the perspective of these different participants. Results from intervention sites in Phase 1 will be analyzed, and used by the investigators, together with local public health officials, to decide on appropriate corrective solutions in each sites. Contact Investigation registries will also be developed with research staff from sites. In Phase 2, solutions for problems identified will be selected and implemented at the intervention sites, Contact Investigation registries will be implemented and clinical training will be provided to strengthen LTBI health care worker knowledge and clinical programs.

Duration of antimicrobial treatment for SAB, other than in cases of Infective endocarditis (IE), recommended by different guidelines relies on risk stratification for relapse of infection rather than definite diagnosis of septic foci that eventually determine the relapse rate. In recently published studies fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET CT was found to be a sensitive imaging test for identifying metastatic infectious foci in Gram-positive bacteremia, including SAB.||Objectives: To examine the impact of using FDG PET CT in the diagnostic algorithm of non-IE SAB compared to standard treatment recommendations on treatment duration and clinical outcomes.||Methods: A prospective interventional non-comparative cohort study conducted at Rambam Health Care Campus. Patients with SAB, defined as microbiologically and clinically, will undergo FDG PET CT 10-14 days following the first positive blood culture for diagnosis of septic extra-cardiac foci of infection. Patients with IE will be excluded. Short (2 weeks) versus long treatment (4-6 weeks) will be recommended for negative and positive PET CT tests, respectively. Patients will be followed-up for 1 year for relapse of infection and mortality.||We will document the sensitivity and specificity of PET CT for detection of complications among patients with SAB. We will examine the percentage of patients in whom the use of PET CT changed treatment duration compared to standard recommendations. We will compare also, the relapse rate and 1 year mortality rate with data from previous studies and local data. Assuming a 15% rate of management changes compared to consensus recommendations, a sample of 150 patients will achieve the required 95% CI.||Significance: Our trial will serve for improving decision making in patients with non-IE SAB, shortening treatment duration in unnecessary cases and decreasing relapse rate by giving prolonged appropriate treatment for metastatic infection not identified by standard management algorithms. PET CT is assuming an increasingly important role in infection diagnosis and management. The current study will be the first to examine the role of PET CT in directing management of patients with SAB.","Staphylococcus Aureus Bacteremia","No","Interventional","August 2015","May 2020","FDG PET CT","Procedure","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Diagnostic","Single Group Assignment","Israel","N/A","143",,

The control of TB requires clearly delineated helper T cell (Th) 1 responses and, to a lesser extent, Th17 responses, which both play important roles in the induction and maintenance of protective immune responses in mouse models of TB infection and in the prevention of active disease, as seen in LTBI. During latency, M. tuberculosis is contained in localized granulomas. Mycobacteria specific T cells mediate delayed type hypersensitivity reactions to purified protein derivative (PPD), and this reaction is generally considered to indicate an LTBI status in the absence of demonstrable active infection.||Among the various risk factors that are known to play a role in promoting active TB, HIV is the most well studied and described. However, in low-HIV-endemic countries like India, other risk factors might play a more prominent role in active TB pathogenesis. These include malnutrition, diabetes mellitus (DM), and helminth infections. LTBI individuals with these comorbidities or coinfections could be at a higher risk for developing active TB than their ""healthy"" LTBI counterparts without these comorbidities. Thus, it is imperative to study the pathogenesis of TB infection and disease in these ""at risk"" populations.||In this study, we will estimate the prevalence of severe to moderate malnutrition, uncontrolled DM, and helminth infections in LTBI-positive individuals.

Keys to successful control of TB is rapid diagnosis, prompt treatment, as well as effective preventive therapy for contacts with latent TB infection (LTBI). Current methods for the diagnosis of LTBI are tuberculin skin test (TST) and interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). For preventive therapy, the recommended regimens include daily isoniazid for 9 months and daily rifampicin for 4 months. By incorporating long-acting rifapentine, a new regimen combining weekly rifapentine and high-dose isoniazid for a total of 12 doses has been proven of equal potency and toxicity. However, the treatment completion rate is much higher in weekly treatment for 3 months than daily treatment for 9 months. It is reasonable that using rifapentine-based preventive therapy can markedly increase the completion rate. However, study is lacking, especially in Asia, the high endemic area of TB.||With the effort of all health care workers and public health personnel, the incidence of TB in Taiwan has gradually declined in recent 10 years.

Patients typically present with a history of chronic cough, eventually progressing to hemoptysis, fever, and hypoxia. With half or more of all patients failing standard three-drug therapy, this is an insidious disease with a poor prognosis. Under the natural history protocol of nontuberculous mycobacterial infection (NTM; #01-I-0202), 46 patients with diagnosed pulmonary MAC disease are being studied. Numerous studies have suggested that a dysregulation in cytokine production may make these patients susceptible to mycobacterial infection. Cytokines are particularly important in the activaction of macrophages, which help to clear mycobacterial infection. Interferon gamma 1b (Actimmune) and GM-CSF (Leukine) are two cytokine therapies that have been approved in the treatment of chronic granulomatous disease and post-transplantation hematopoietic reconstitution, respectively. A number of in vitro studies suggest that either or both of these therapies may help to clear MAC infection. Given the poor outcomes of therapy and the persistent, debilitating nature of the disease, new therapies are desperately needed, and many are being tried without benefit of scientific foundation. Currently, there are no prospective trials that show any effect of these drugs in the lung delivered subcutaneously.

This study will evaluate an innovative, community-based intervention that addresses critical individual level factors which are potential mechanisms that underlie health disparities in completing TBI treatment among the predominantly minority homeless. The study hypothesis is that improving these conditions, and promoting health by focused screening for TBI, and early detection and treatment for these vulnerable adults will improve TB treatment completion and prevent future TB disease.||The proposed theoretically-based health promotion intervention focuses on: 1) completion of TBI treatment, 2) reducing substance use; 3) improving mental health; and 4) improving critical social determinants of TB risk (unstable housing and poor health care access) among homeless adults in the highest TB prevalence area in Los Angeles. A total of 76 homeless adults with TBI will receive this program which includes culturally-sensitive education, case management, and directly observed therapy (DOT) delivery of medication among patients who have been prescribed 3HP (12 weeks treatment for latent TB infection) by a medical provider. This study will determine whether this intervention can achieve higher completion rates than the 65% completion rate among homeless persons reported by previous TB programs.","Latent Tuberculosis Infection","No","Interventional","January 24, 2019","September 4, 2020","Nurse-led Community Health Worker TBI (RN/CHW TBI) program","Behavioral","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Prevention","Single Group Assignment","United States|United States","N/A","50",,

Survival of AIDS patients with MAC is shorter than those without MAC. Studies show that treatment for MAC improves the survival of MAC infected patients to nearly the survival of AIDS patients without MAC. Treatment of MAC with clarithromycin containing regimens is associated with decreased symptoms and prolonged survival. There is evidence, however, that mycobacterial infection may enhance propagation of the human immunodeficiency virus through mechanisms that may involve enhanced expression of pro inflammatory cytokines.

A total of 900 YMSM will be enrolled into this study from the clinics of community partners in Chicago, New York, and Atlanta.||Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two versions of the program. Some topics in the program include HIV facts and myths, sexually transmitted infections (STIs), and condom use. All participants, regardless of the program version they receive, will also take at-home urine and rectal tests for the STIs chlamydia and gonorrhea. After completing the program, participants will be contacted three more times over the course of a year for follow-up sessions and surveys.||The research team hypothesizes that the YMSM-specific prevention program will lead to a significant reduction in the frequency of unprotected anal sex acts and new STI infections compared to the HIV knowledge program that is for a general audience. The YMSM-specific program will also lead to improvements in secondary knowledge, motivation, and skills outcomes.||In order for the research team to measure the effectiveness of the YMSM-specific prevention program and determine if the study hypothesis is correct, participants will be asked questions about themselves, including questions about their sexual orientation, sexual experiences, health practices, including drug use, health knowledge, and questions about their feelings and emotions. Based on this information, the research team hopes to later change, improve, or expand the program to better address the needs of YMSM.","HIV|Gonorrhea|Chlamydia","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","May 2013","March 2017","Keep It Up!|HIV Knowledge Control","Behavioral|Behavioral","Not Applicable","Male","29 Years","18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","United States|United States|United States","Randomized","901","0|0","11|13"

There has been a relative dearth of research dedicated to understanding these health disparities between gay/bisexual and heterosexual youth, and even less has focused on identifying factors that might promote resilience against negative health outcomes. Understanding both risk factors and processes of resilience is critical in developing efficacious interventions to improve health in this population.||Through a grant from the National Institutes of Health, the investigators completed formative research with young male couples. Qualitative interviews identified preferences for couples-based intervention format and content. While coupled YMSM expressed some interest in HIV prevention, they were most interested in building relationship skills. Coupled YMSM preferred group-based interventions in order to meet and learn from other couples but had concerns about discussing personal topics in groups. Quantitative analyses found that the rate of condomless sex in couples increased from adolescence to young adulthood. Further, the influence of older partners, partner violence, and drinking before sex were strongest in emerging adulthood. Informed by these, the investigators developed 2GETHER, which aims to reduce HIV transmission risk in couples by enhancing relationship functioning. 2GETHER is a four session program. The first two sessions are group sessions aimed at skills building, and the second two sessions are individualized couple sessions aimed at skills implementation. Modules address communication skills, coping with stress (both general and sexual minority-specific stress), relationship sexual satisfaction, and HIV transmission risk within the dyad and with outside partners. 2GETHER was designed to address HIV transmission risk in couples regardless of HIV status; couples learn to use behavioral and biomedical approaches to prevent both HIV acquisition (e.g., HIV testing, condom use, pre-exposure prophylaxis) and transmission (e.g., medication adherence to reduce viral load), with an overarching emphasis on the health of the couple.||The investigators completed a pilot trial of 2GETHER with funding from Northwestern University. The pilot trial enrolled 57 couples (N=114) and demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of 2GETHER. This pilot trial used a non-randomized pre-/post-test design because the goal was to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects in a large number of diverse couples to inform a future efficacy RCT. Post-test occurred 2 weeks post-intervention, or ~2 months post-baseline. The pilot trial recruited a diverse sample of couples in less than one year and each program module receive high ratings of acceptability during post-sessions evaluation and an exit interview. At the 2-week post-test, the investigators observed significant decreases in HIV risk behavior, improvements in motivation to reduce HIV risk, and improvements in relationship investment.||The current study will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to test the efficacy of 2GETHER, a novel couples-based intervention for young men who have sex with men (YMSM) that aims to reduce HIV transmission risk by optimizing relationship functioning. This RCT will be implemented online; both the experimental and control condition will be administered via video-conferencing technology to couples across the United States.

This risk is reduced but not completely eliminated when HIV is treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Both the British HIV Association (BHIVA) and National Institute of Health and Care Excellence (NICE) suggest testing for latent TB infection in HIV infected individuals, but use different criteria. The cost -effectiveness of either approach has not been assessed, nor is testing widespread. A certain proportion of HIV infected subjects in Africa have MTb detectable in their sputum despite not having symptoms (such as cough or weight loss), nor changes on a chest x ray. It is unclear if this happens in lower TB prevalence areas such as the United Kingdom (UK). We intend to test a cohort of HIV infected subjects for evidence of latent TB using a tuberculin skin test (TST) and Interferon Gamma Release Assay (IGRA), ask about symptoms (using a standardised questionnaire) and to induce sputum using a saline nebuliser, to detect MTb using microscopy and culture, and newer nucleic acid amplification (genetic) techniques. Some patients, despite being exposed to TB in the past, will not mount a response using an IGRA or TST, which maybe due to an abnormal immune response. This lack of response seems more common in HIV. By investigating the number of patients with positive TST, IGRA, chest X ray and evidence of MTb in their sputum, in the context of place of birth, previous exposure to TB, CD4 count and other medications, we can assess the cost- effectiveness of systematic TB screening and the use anti-TB antibiotics to prevent reactivation of TB.

4273,"Unknown status","Background: The TB and HIV epidemics are closely linked in developing countries, where 450,000 children die from HIV annually. TB is a major cause of death in HIV-infected children and is reversing gains made in child survival.||The traditional tuberculin skin test (TST) has limited diagnostic accuracy for detecting TB infection. Adult studies suggest that new blood-based diagnostic TB testing offers a quicker, more accurate way to diagnose TB infection. Such diagnostic testing may directly guide clinical management and preventive strategies in immune-suppressed HIV-infected children, who are at high risk of becoming TB diseased following infection. Data regarding the usefulness of these tests in children is currently limited.||Objective(s) and Hypothesis(es): The investigators hypothesize that blood-based TB diagnostic testing can accurately identify children with TB infection. In a community with high rates of TB and HIV infection, the following specific aims will be investigated in HIV-infected and uninfected children:||assess the agreement between the TST and blood-based diagnostic testing,|compare the performance of the TST and blood-based diagnostic testing to a standardized history of TB exposure,|measure the impact of age, nutritional and immune status on children's response to blood-based testing,|describe factors that might modify children's response to testing over time, and 5) examine the effect of environmental exposures and previous vaccination on the TST, blood-based testing and other measures of immune responses to TB.||Potential Impact: The benefits of an accurate, rapid diagnostic test of TB infection in children include 1) timely institution of treatment for TB infection to prevent severe disease and mortality, and 2) preclusion of over diagnosis and treatment. Treatment of childhood TB infection also prevents future contagious adult disease, thus decreasing community transmission. Blood-based diagnostic testing may also be able to identify children that are more likely to become ill following TB infection. Therefore, blood-based diagnostic testing has great potential to improve TB control and the health of HIV-infected and uninfected children, their households and communities.","Latent Tuberculosis Infection|Tuberculosis|HIV Infections","No","Observational","October 2007","September 2010",,,,"All","15 Years","3 Months",,,"South Africa",,"250",,

4276,"Unknown status","Ticks are the major arthropod vectors transmitting pathogenic agents to humans and domestic animals in Europe, and currently, the incidence of tick-borne disease is rising. The most common European human tick-borne disease is Lyme borreliosis, with an estimated 90 000 new cases every year (compared to 300 000 new cases in the United States annually). This disease is initially clinically diagnosed by the presence of migrating erythema following a tick bite, which is then subsequently confirmed by serological tests. In parallel with classic Lyme borreliosis cases, tick-bitten patients can also present with polymorphic and on-specific clinical symptoms (asthenia, fever, myalgia, etc. …) for which there is no known etiological diagnosis. It is extremely difficult to determine the proportion of tick-bitten patients with these symptoms compared to patients which have actually contracted Lyme disease, although it is estimated that 50% of fevers following a tick bite have an unknown infectious origin.||Typical tick habitats are woodlands, prairies, pastures, and gardens. Ticks are extremely sensitive to environmental fluctuations, which are often brought about by human socio-economic changes, thus tick-borne diseases are excellent candidates for emergence. Consequently, it is incontestable that tickborne diseases pose a significant threat to our society. In addition to improving diagnostic techniques, one of the major hurdles relates to improving public and health professional knowledge about tick disease risk. The battle against tick-borne diseases is based on relatively simple prevention measures, and their effectiveness is immeasurably improved when citizens are more informed and involved.Therefore, a multidisciplinary project, bringing together veterinarians, doctors, scientists, and consultant sociologists has been designed to create a global ""One Health"" approach to tick-borne diseases. Specific scientific project objectives are to (1) detect, identify, and isolate new microorganisms-both unknown or unexpected-from patients or animals suffering from unexplainable symptoms following tick bites; (2) to demonstrate tick competence in their ability to transmit these agents; and (3) to generate concrete recommendations to improve tick-borne disease management.","Lyme Disease","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","June 1, 2018","June 2020","Blood samples|skin biopsy","Diagnostic Test|Diagnostic Test",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"France",,"130",,

In 2010 and subsequently modified in 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended increased dosages of the first-line anti-TB drugs for children, but there were no child-friendly fixed-dose combination (FDC) formulations based on the guidelines. A large proportion of children treated with the new guidelines using old formulations did not achieve the desired rifampin peak concentration (Cmax) > 8 mg/L and pyrazinamide Cmax > 35 mg/L. The TB Alliance and the WHO led the development of a new child-appropriate isoniazid/rifampin/pyrazinamide (HRZ) and isoniazid/rifampin (HR) FDC formulation in line with current WHO recommended dosing guidelines. The new formulations dissolve quickly in liquid, have palatable fruit flavors, and are expected to improved daily adherence but no studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PK) of the FDC formulation in children. The study team hypothesize that the new dispersible HRZ FDC tablet, dosed according to current WHO weight-band dosing recommendations will result in better PK parameters for each drug component than that achieved by the old formulation.","Tuberculosis|Human Immunodeficiency Virus|Coinfection","No","Observational","January 28, 2019","August 31, 2023","Observational PK study","Other",,"All","14 Years","3 Months",,,"Ghana",,"92",,

It is not known why some people become sick and most do not, but the immune system of people who never develop disease may be better able to control the bacteria. This study will evaluate the latent form of M. tuberculosis infection to further the understanding of the immune mechanisms - particularly the role of certain white blood cells - involved in the disease process.||Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, family history of medical conditions, sexual history, history of drug use, physical examination and blood tests, including a test for HIV. People in Mali, West Africa, and in local health clinics in the United States may participate.||At the start of the study, participants have blood tests and a tuberculin skin test (PPD test), which indicates whether a person has been exposed to tuberculosis bacteria. For the PPD, a tiny amount of liquid containing dead tuberculosis antigen is put under the skin of the forearm with a needle. The antigen cannot cause infection or disease.||After 3 days, participants have another blood test and the site of the tuberculin test is examined for swelling that would indicate a positive result. Participants with a positive PPD have a chest x-ray to check for tuberculosis disease. Those whose x-ray is also positive are withdrawn from the study and referred to their doctor for evaluation and treatment. Those whose x-ray is negative return to the clinic within 3 weeks of the tuberculin test to give another blood sample.||Participants whose PPD is negative have a second tuberculin test 10 to 21 days later and return 3 days after the test to determine if it is still negative or if it is positive. (Some people who are negative after the first test may test positive after the second procedure.) Those whose test is still negative end their participation in the study at that time. Participants whose second PPD is positive have a chest x-ray as described above, and those with a negative chest x-ray return in 3 weeks to donate one last blood sample.||The purpose of the present study is to evaluate the latent form of this infection, the prevalence of which worldwide exceeds that of active disease. Our hypothesis is that in latent tuberculosis antigen specific effector memory CD4+ T cells are responsible for the generation of clinically measurable delayed type hypersensitivity and that central memory CD4+T cells are not directly involved in this process. We base this idea on the assumption that latent tuberculosis is a state of antigen persistence and that effector memory T cells should be maintained as long as antigen/infection is present.||We propose to conduct this study in Mali, West Africa and local clinics in the U.S. Tuberculosis affects 593/100,000(2) individuals in Mali and most have been exposed to the disease. Additionally it would be important to evaluate the same parameters locally as latent infection is one of the major factors for reactivation tuberculosis in this country. Patients would be enrolled in 4 major groups: HIV-/TST- (Group A), HIV-/TST+ (Group B), HIV+/TST+(G roup C) and HIV+/TST- (Group D).||To evaluate this hypothesis we plan to enroll between 100 - 300 patients over the course of 2 years from both countries. Blood samples before and at predetermined time points after the application of Purified Protein Derivative (PPD) will be obtained to determine the fraction of CD4+ T cells which produce interferon gamma in response to stimulation with PPD with a 16hr antigen stimulation assay. Appropriate staining will be done to ascertain the phenotype as well as cytokine production (Interferon gamma,( IFN gamma), Interleukin 2 (IL2) and Tumour Necrosis Factor ( TNF)). Additionally lymphocyte proliferation will be studied using 5-(and-6)-carboxyflouorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE.)||In conducting this study we hope to further the understanding of the immune mechanisms involved, particularly mechanisms of T cell memory, which would provide insights into TB and HIV pathogenesis. We also believe that understanding these mechanisms could lead towards establishment of surrogates for immunity in TB vaccine studies, which could enhance vaccine trial design.

Some of these infections are rare: for example, few children in Western Europe are living with HIV, so the studies often have fairly small numbers of participants. This can make it difficult to answer research questions in these cohorts and means that doctors and researchers working with these patients in different countries need to work together. This is particularly important as children are not often included in clinical trials of treatments and other interventions.||The European Pregnancy and Paediatric Infections Cohort Collaboration (EPPICC) is an international network of researchers working together in this way. Researchers in the network represent cohort studies of pregnant women and children with, or at risk of, infections from across Europe and Thailand. The research focuses on infections in pregnant women and children, particularly HIV, hepatitis B and C virus, and tuberculosis, and, from 2020, novel coronavirus (COVID-19). By combining data from many cohorts, the researchers aim to answer questions that could not be answered by one study individually (for example, because a large number of pregnant women or children are needed to answer the question).||This protocol focuses on the paediatric component of EPPICC's research, which focuses on the treatment of children at risk of and living with infections. For example, what medicines are used most often and how do they affect children's health? EPPICC is an observational study, which means that children do not receive any extra treatment as part of the study. Instead, children are ""observed"" during their routine medical care. Each cohort keeps records of the children's health collected at routine clinic visits, including information such as date of birth and sex, results of diagnostic tests, treatments received, and any illnesses or other events that the children have had. The EPPICC study combines and analyses data from all of the cohorts that take part, to answer questions about the risks and benefits of different diagnosis or treatment strategies, the long-term effects of infection and treatment during childhood and young adulthood, and regional variations (e.g. between Western and Eastern Europe) in the risk and management of infections.||All of the data collected through the EPPICC Paediatric Protocol are stored securely at the Medical Research Council Clinical Trials Unit (MRC CTU) at UCL. Data collection and storage are governed by the General Data Protection Regulation. A Steering Committee guides the research to make sure it is relevant and of high quality. Public and patient involvement (PPI) may be provided by individual cohorts' own groups, as well as by the interlinked Penta organisation, which is a network of paediatricians and researchers working in infections in Europe and globally.

4409,"Completed","Shigellosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in young children in Bangladesh and other developing countries. Further, the increasing emergence of resistance to a wide range of antibiotics is of great concern. Another major public health problem in Bangladesh is malnutrition, which is closely linked with shigellosis and with a high mortality. In Shigellosis, a heavy nutritional burden is placed on children and vital micronutrients such as vitamin A is lost in the urine. We recently found that the immune response in S. Flexneri infection was lower in children who were severely malnourished (weight-for-age≤65% as a percentage of the National Centre for Health Statistics median) when compared to children with weight-for-age from >65-75%. T cell responses were primarily affected with lowered CD4/CD8 ratios, lowered proliferative responses to T cell mitogens, Conconavalin A (ConA) and phytohaemagglutinin (PHA). However, proliferation of pheripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMs) was lowered only in the presence of autologous plasma suggesting that a factor(s) in plasma, probably nutritional, rather than a defect in cells themselves was responsible. In children with S. dysenteriae 1 infection, proliferative responses to PHA were similarly lowered in the presence of autologous plasma but inhibition correlated to lowered transferring levels in plasma and not to the weight-for-age of the children. Also severely malnourished children with either S. flexneri or S. dysenteriae 1 infection were more severely ill. These findingings show that immunity in malnourishrd children with shigella infection is impaired which may lead to more severe illness. As zinc has profound effects on immunity as well as clinical outcome in diarrhoeal diseases, it is possible that zinc deficiency may be a factor in reducing immunity and increasing severity of acute illness in malnourished children with shigellosis. In this study, we will investigate the effect of zinc supplementation, in a double blind placebo controlled trial, on inflammatory responses, outcome of acute illness and growth following recovery from acute illness with S. flexneri infection.","Testing Effect of Intervention","No","Interventional","January 1999","April 2002","Children in the zinc group received 20 mg of elemental zinc as acetate per day in a twice-daily dose for two weeks.","Drug","Phase 3","All","59 Months","12 Months","Treatment","Single Group Assignment",,"Randomized","56",,

Current treatment is similar to treatment of lung TB, although penetration of some antibiotics into the brain is poor and the immune-pathology of TB meningitis is very different from pulmonary TB. In a recent phase II clinical trial from the investigators group, the first of its kind globally, intensified antibiotic treatment, with moxifloxacin and high dose rifampicin, strongly reduced mortality of TB meningitis.||The investigators aim to examine the effect of intensified antibiotic treatment on mortality and morbidity of TB meningitis in a phase 3 clinical trial, preceded with an explorative pharmacokinetic (PK) study to examine if higher oral doses rifampicin result in exposures similar to the i.v. dose used in our phase 2 trial, since oral rifampicin could be implemented much easier in low-resource settings.","Tuberculous Meningitis","No","Interventional","June 2013","April 2014","Rifampicin intravenous|Oral rifampicin","Drug|Drug","Phase 2","All","65 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Indonesia","Randomized","30",,

The incidence of TBM has increased considerably during the last decade, partly due to the HIV epidemic. Without treatment, virtually all patients with TB meningitis will die. With the current treatment regimens, TBM is fatal in approximately 30-50% of cases, and responsible for severe disability in a similar proportion of survivors.||Worldwide, Indonesia the third highest case load of tuberculosis with an estimated 500,000 new patients / year.

Therefore, there is an urgent need to evaluate intensified treatment of TBM in randomized trials. We hypothesize that higher dose rifampicin, moxifloxacin (possibly also at high dose), or both will improve outcome of TBM.

There has been a relative dearth of research dedicated to understanding these health disparities between gay/bisexual and heterosexual youth, and even less has focused on identifying factors that might promote resilience against negative health outcomes. Understanding both risk factors and processes of resilience is critical in developing efficacious interventions to improve health in this population.||Through a grant from the National Institutes of Health, the investigators completed formative research with young male couples. Qualitative interviews identified preferences for couples-based intervention format and content. While coupled YMSM expressed some interest in HIV prevention, participants were most interested in building relationship skills. Coupled YMSM preferred group-based interventions in order to meet and learn from other couples but had concerns about discussing personal topics in groups. Quantitative analyses found that the rate of condomless sex in couples increased from adolescence to young adulthood. Further, the influence of older partners, partner violence, and drinking before sex were strongest in emerging adulthood. Informed by these, the research team developed 2GETHER, which aims to reduce HIV transmission risk in couples by enhancing relationship functioning. 2GETHER is a four session program. The first two sessions are group sessions aimed at skills building, and the second two sessions are individualized couple sessions aimed at skills implementation. Modules address communication skills, coping with stress (both general and sexual minority-specific stress), relationship sexual satisfaction, and HIV transmission risk within the dyad and with outside partners. 2GETHER was designed to address HIV transmission risk in couples regardless of HIV status; couples learn to use behavioral and biomedical approaches to prevent both HIV acquisition (e.g., HIV testing, condom use, pre-exposure prophylaxis) and transmission (e.g., medication adherence to reduce viral load), with an overarching emphasis on the health of the couple.||The investigators completed a pilot trial of 2GETHER with funding from Northwestern University. The pilot trial enrolled 57 couples (N=114) and demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of 2GETHER. This pilot trial used a non-randomized pre-/post-test design because the goal was to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and preliminary effects in a large number of diverse couples to inform a future efficacy RCT. Post-test occurred 2 weeks post-intervention, or ~2 months post-baseline. The pilot trial recruited a diverse sample of couples in less than one year and each program module receive high ratings of acceptability during post-sessions evaluation and an exit interview.

CAP also frequently associates with other disorders responsible for admission and death. Among bacteria responsible for CAP, Streptococcus pneumonia is a major pathogen that is commonly involved and frequently leads to severe infection and admission. Categories at risk for this pathogen have been determined, and can be proposed anti-pneumococcal vaccination (APV) that efficiently and safely protects from this microorganism.||In the context of US health services, monocenter pilot experiences have reported improvement of pneumococcal prophylaxis implementing vaccination procedure at ED. A study that set in New Mexico (2003) reported a significant increase in APV (from 18% to 84%) when patients at risk were proposed vaccination at ED. To obtain these results, medical students were specifically trained and dedicated to screen and vaccinate against St. pneumoniae. Another single center trial (Tennessee, 2007) for APV at ED obtained an improvement (from 38.8 to 45.4%) when physicians were alerted for pneumococcal risk by the software they usually utilized at bedside. However these experiences remain sparse as additional dedicated resources are required or patients and attending ED physicians can be reluctant to proceed to vaccination at ED.||Mobile phone and derived communication modalities are current vectors to deliver information in several fields including education and medicine. Initially used in developing countries, short-message services (SMS) have improved behaviour of patients in various medical areas. In France, the investigators have observed that most patients above 50 years of age admitted after ED visit are equipped with mobile phone and can receive alerts by SMS.||These observations prompt us to propose a multifaceted procedure to improve APV after ED visit in at-risk patients, combining structured oral interview, written information and SMS as reminders.||Purpose : The investigators hypothesized that||a multifaceted intervention to promote anti-pneumococcal vaccination combining a structured oral interview, a written information to patient and his/her general practitioner, and a series of 3 SMS,|improves anti-pneumococcal vaccination at 6 months,|in at-risk patients (65+ years) visiting the emergency department.

The results from the second study (dose escalation with ID, IN and IM vaccination) showed that GSK3536852A vaccine is well-tolerated also when administered by the ID and IN routes of vaccination.

4462,"Completed","Helicobacter pylori is recognized as a major gastrointestinal pathogen in developing countries. This microorganism infects up to 60% of children less than five years in those countries and is strongly associated with chronic gastritis and peptic ulcer disease in children and adults. The progression of gastritis to atrophy often leads to decreased gastric acid output, which is a well-known risk factor for anemia. Gastric acid is essential for increasing the bioavailability and absorption of non-heme dietary iron, the most important source of iron in developing countries. Numerous reports suggest that iron malabsorption secondary to low gastric acid output is a problem in developing world countries. It has been further observed that iron deficiency anemia is resistant to iron therapy particularly in these countries. In a recently completed study we observed an association of anaemia with H. pylori infection. We hypothesize that the poor bioavailability of iron in these countries could be related to H. pylori -induced low gastric acid output and we propose to investigate the role of H. pylori infection as a cause of anemia and treatment failure of iron supplementation in Bangladesh. A prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled field trial is proposed among four groups ( 65 each) of H. Pylori infected children of 2-5 years of age with iron deficiency anemia. The children will be assigned to one of the four therapies: antibiotics alone (for H. Pylori eradication), antibiotic plus iron therapy, iron therapy alone, or placebo. Hemoglobin concentration, serum ferritin concentration, and transferrin receptor will be measured before and at 1 and 3 month after the intervention. We also propose a complementary study in an additional 20 children with H. Pylori infection and iron deficiency anemia to assess iron absorption with application of double stable isotopes. The change in hematological parameters will also be compared among the groups before and after the therapy.

If not properly treated, syphilis can also lead to heart problems and dementia (a decline in reasoning, memory and other mental abilities) years down the road. There has been an increase in the number of reported cases of syphilis in North America, Europe, and Australia over the past decade. The number of new syphilis infections in Canada has increased roughly 10-fold over the past 10 years.||Since 1943, the antibiotic penicillin has been used to treat syphilis; however, very little information has been gathered to determine the proper dose of penicillin or appropriate duration of treatment. Added to this, several studies have shown that the recommended dose of penicillin fails to cure syphilis in 20-30% of patients. Since the number of people infected with syphilis is increasing, and since syphilis has the potential to cause serious disease, the investigators need better information on how to treat syphilis effectively.||This study aims to determine whether the current dose of penicillin recommended to treat syphilis is sufficient to cure the infection.

It is recommended that people who are likely to get DMAC be placed on preventive medications which help reduce the risk of infection. New anti-HIV combination drug therapies can increase CD4 cell counts and can reduce the level of HIV in the blood. When CD4 counts are increased, risk of DMAC infection is less.

4473,"Enrolling by invitation","The reported incidence of uveitis is 52 persons per year per 100,000 population, with a greater incidence estimated in developing countries, including Indonesia. Uveitis has challenges in diagnosis and therapy, due to the existence of an immunological privilege mechanism, so it is not easy to obtain diagnostic markers or provide appropriate therapy. In uveitis, a work-up examination looking for signs in the entire body or systemic disease is often conducted.||Up until today, establishing the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB)-associated uveitis is still a challenge. From histopathological studies, TB germs are difficult to find. Wreblowski et al. found that paucibacillary conditions also made TB bacteria difficult to find by PCR and tuberculin test results were also not completely reliable. The development of IGRA (Interferon-Gamma Release Assay) assays, such as QuantiFERON-Gold TB (QFT) has been investigated. Our previous study found that IGRA-positive uveitis patients with type 1 IFN gene expression score >5.61 were more likely to have active TB uveitis. In addition, serum C1q examination also showed an inverse correlation with this score.||Regarding therapy, until now corticosteroids and cycloplegics are the mainstay treatment for uveitis. However, appropriate administration of anti-infective drugs is necessary in cases of infection. Inflammation in TB-associated uveitis is thought to be the result of the immune response that occurs as a result of paucibacillary TB infection. Examinations can be redundant and problematic. Determination of therapy is also a dilemma because it is difficult to determine the right patient candidate for administration of anti-tuberculosis therapy (ATT). The protocol of ATT administration itself has not been standardized so it often follows the extra pulmonary TB protocol and there has been no reliable clinical trial research on ATT administration in patients with suspected TB uveitis yet no TB microorganisms are found directly in the eyes or other organs.||On this basis, the investigators planned a prospective randomized clinical trial study that involve idiopathic uveitis patients with positive IGRA test, to assess the effectivity of ATT compared to oral steroids. In addition, this study can also be used as a basis for validation of type 1 IFN scores and serum C1q as diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers in cases of TB-associated uveitis.","Tuberculous Uveitis","No","Interventional","July 27, 2021","June 2024","Anti Tuberculosis Drug|Prednisone tablet","Drug|Drug","Phase 2","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Indonesia","Randomized","80",,

4481,"Completed","HIV/Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection have profound effects on the host's immune system. TB is the most common cause of death in patients with HIV worldwide. Rifamycins (such as rifampicin [RIF]) are an important component of TB therapy because of their unique activity. The problem is that most protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) used to treat HIV have significant drug-drug interactions with RIF that can lead to reduced concentrations of these agents with risk of treatment failure or resistance. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz (EFV) does not present the same significant drug interactions with RIF. EFV-based HIV treatment was tested in patients concomitantly treated with RIF-containing TB therapy, demonstrating that their co-administration can be used safely and effectively. However, the side effect profile of EFV overlaps with the RIF-containing TB regimens and makes the management of treatment toxicities very complex. Integrase inhibitors (INI), such as dolutegravir (DTG), may offer an important alternative to EFV-based therapy in TB coinfected patients. A Phase I drug-drug interaction study was conducted in healthy, HIV-seronegative subjects, and showed that DTG at 50 mg twice daily given together with RIF was well-tolerated and resulted in DTG concentrations similar to those of DTG 50 mg given once daily alone, which is the recommended dose for INI-naive patients. Therefore, ART regimens using DTG 50 mg twice daily may represent a new treatment option for TB-infected patients who require concurrent treatment for HIV infection. This is a Phase III b, randomized, open-label study describing the efficacy and safety of DTG and EFV-containing ART regimens in HIV/TB co-infected patients. This study is designed to assess the antiviral activity of DTG or efavirenz (EFV) ART-containing regimens through 48 weeks. A total of approximately 115 +/-5% subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to DTG (approximately 69 subjects) and EFV (approximately 46 subjects), respectively.

Infants also routinely receive a meningococcal group C vaccine (MenC) at 3 and 4 months and a 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine (Prevenar13) at 2 and 4 months of age. This study aims to offer infants a 6-in-1 vaccine (Infanrix-Hexa)that also helps protect against hepatitis B alongside the other routine vaccinations in the UK infant immunisation schedule and assess their immune responses to the different vaccines. Hepatitis B virus infects the liver and usually affects adults, but children can be infected through close contact with carriers of the virus. Children with hepatitis B infection may not have symptoms for many years but may go on to develop liver failure, cirrhosis and cancer. Many other countries already use Infanrix-Hexa and this study is being undertaken to help decide whether the UK can do the same. Babies taking part in this study will receive Infanrix-Hexa instead of Pediacel. All other vaccines given will be the same as in the routine schedule but will include one MenC vaccine instead of 2 doses because the UK infant immunisation schedule is soon going to change so that all babies will receive only one MenC vaccine at 3 months of age.||There are currently several licensed MenC vaccines that can be given to babies.

It is estimated that one-third of the world's population is infected. HIV is the main predisposing factor for TB development. The Brazilian Ministry of Health and the World Health Organization recommends that patients should initially be treated orally with RIPE - rifampicin (R), isoniazid (I), pyrazinamide (P) and ethambutol (E). The N-acetylcysteine (NAC) first benefit was reported during the 1960s, when it proved to be an effective mucolytic agent in individuals with cystic fibrosis. Later, a new role arose when investigating its therapeutic potential in acetaminophen intoxication. Cleavage of the acetyl group makes cysteine available for later incorporation into glutathione synthesis, decreased in hepatic injury caused by acetaminophen. This mechanism causes NAC to have an indirect antioxidant effect, which aroused an interest in studying the effect in diseases that occur with oxidative stress. TB and HIV/Aids are also diseases with chronic inflammation. The present study aims to evaluate the effects of NAC as a adjuvant therapy in the treatment of TB. This is a phase II randomized clinical trial in which the safety and tolerability of NAC as adjunctive therapy for TB treatment will be assessed.

Although the intestinal microbiome contains bacteria, fungi, and viruses, research in the field of liver disease has almost exclusively focused on the interaction between the host and gut bacteria. The fungal microbiota is an integral part of the gastrointestinal micro-ecosystem with up to 106 microorganisms per gram of faeces. Numerous interactions between fungi and bacteria and the complex immune response to gastrointestinal commensal or pathogenic fungi have been demonstrated in prior studies. Alcohol-dependent patients display a reduced intestinal fungal diversity and Candida overgrowth. Compared with healthy individuals and patients with non-alcohol-related cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis patients also demonstrate systemic exposure and immune response to mycobiota. Thus, chronic alcohol consumption is associated with an altered mycobiota and translocation of fungal products. Manipulating the intestinal mycobiome might be an effective strategy for attenuating alcohol-related liver disease especially alcoholic hepatitis. In this study, we will attempt to find out the natural fungal mycobiome in Severe alcoholic hepatitis when compared with apparently healthy asymptomatic controls from their family. This will allow us to therapeutically modify the unbalanced gut microbiota and improve patient outcomes. Secondly, it will provide further insight as to why alcohol-associated hepatitis patients are particularly susceptible to fungal infections.

Currently in the UK, 3 doses of a vaccine called Prevenar 13 (PCV-13), which contains 13 pneumococcal serotypes attached to a carrier protein called CRM197, are given to children at 2, 4 and 12 months of age. There is some evidence that a vaccine called Synflorix (PHiD-CV) may be at least as good as the currently used vaccine when used as an alternative vaccine at 12 months of age. Although PHiD-CV contains only 10 serotypes, there is evidence that it generates cross-reactive antibodies against two of the three additional serotypes included in PCV-13 which might be enough to protect children against disease caused by these two serotypes. Furthermore, previous studies have shown that PHiD-CV confers protection against a common otitis media pathogen in children called nontypeable H. influenzae (NTHi) by attachment to a carrier protein called Protein D, which is derived from NTHi. In addition, the use of a carrier protein, which is not closely related to an antigen included in any coadministered or previously administered routine vaccine minimises the risk of interference related to it.||The investigators aim to recruit 168 healthy children at the age of 12 months who have already received two doses of PCV-13 according to the UK routine immunisation schedule at 2 and 4 months of age.

Building upon Uganda's growing mHealth infrastructure to pilot a scalable short message service (SMS) system to remind caregivers of their children's upcoming vaccination visits, it was hypothesized that the SMS intervention will increase immunization coverage in a cost-effective and affordable manner that would make it scalable. The study design was an investigator-blinded, multi-center, parallel groups randomized controlled trial with randomization occurring at the caregiver level in select health facilities of Arua District in Uganda. Enrollment took place at the time of Pentavalent 1 vaccination, and both arms included standard of care provided by the health worker. However, in the intervention arm, caregivers also received SMS text messages reminding them to return for their children's second and third doses of Pentavalent vaccine (four and eight weeks after the first dose of Pentavalent vaccine) and measles-containing vaccine (9 months of age). The primary outcome of interest is vaccination coverage at 12 months of age among children enrolled in the study and will be measured by comparing Penta3 and MCV coverage between arms. The study will also examine the SMS impact on timeliness of vaccine receipt, as it is hypothesized that those children receiving the SMS intervention will be more likely to have timely vaccination than those in the control group. The study will also assess caregiver acceptability and cost-effectiveness of the SMS intervention. In addition to assessing its impact on strengthening the immunization program, this intervention has implications for strengthening other programs of the health system through similar health messaging directed toward caregivers.","Diphtheria|Tetanus|Pertussis|Polio|Measles|Hepatitis B|Haemophilus Influenzae Type b Infection","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","February 1, 2016","December 4, 2017","SMS text reminders","Behavioral","Not Applicable","All",,"14 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment",,"Randomized","1962",,

However, it can occasionally cause serious disease including meningitis. Vaccines have proven effective in preventing disease associated with a number of strains of this bacterium, however some disease-causing strains are not covered by currently available vaccines. This research is focused on exploring new approaches to preventing colonisation and disease caused by this bacterium.||Neisseria lactamica is a 'good bacteria' that colonises the nose and throat of young children. It does not cause disease in healthy people. In a previous study it has been demonstrated that the introduction of Neisseria lactamica into the noses of healthy adult volunteers resulted in a significant decrease in Neisseria meningitidis colonisation. However, it is not yet understood why this effect occurs. One theory is that the immune response the body mounts in response to colonisation with the 'good bacteria' cross-reacts with the 'bad bacteria' and in so doing eradicates the bad bacteria from the nose and throat. This study aims to outline the nature of the immune responses mounted in response to colonisation with the good bacteria, N. lactamica, after introducing it into the noses of healthy adult volunteers. In addition, the study aims to establish how the introduction of the good bacteria changes the other bacterial populations that live in the nose and throat.","Meningitis, Bacterial","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","September 1, 2018","September 1, 2019","N. lactamica|PBS only","Biological|Other","Early Phase 1","All","45 Years","18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","United Kingdom","Randomized","31",,

4742,"Withdrawn","A dramatic rise in syphilis has been recently reported in the US between 2000-2017, which was followed also by a dramatic rise in congenital syphilis (CS). In 2017 there were 918 CS cases reported in the United States, including 64 syphilitic stillbirths. In 2017, California (CA) had one of the highest syphilis rates among women and this was accompanied by a dramatic increase in CS cases. Approximately 40% of CS cases in the United States occurred from maternal infections acquired late in gestation, missed by current-early gestation only-prenatal screening. More frequent prenatal screening late in gestation is urgently needed. However, cost considerations and operational logistic limitations preclude implementation even in high risk regions. There is an urgent need for widespread implementation of more frequent prenatal screening using alternative cost-saving screening approaches. The Syphilis-Health-Check (SHC) point-of-care (POC) test is a well validated POC-test that is already commercially available in the US, is approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-waived. POC prenatal syphilis screening late in gestation using a well validated POC-test (in addition to the standard early gestation-screening with laboratory-based tests) could provide a cost-saving complementary alternative that could benefit patients, mitigate the higher cost associated with more frequent testing, overcome operational limitations and contribute to the elimination of CS. Moreover, POC-neonatal and placental screening could provide an additional complementary safeguard approach to decrease missed/delayed CS diagnoses.","Maternal Syphilis During Pregnancy - Baby Not Yet Delivered|Congenital Syphilis","No","Interventional","October 30, 2019","October 29, 2023","Syphilis Health Check POC-test (Diagnostics Direct LLC, NJ)","Diagnostic Test","Not Applicable","Female",,"18 Years","Diagnostic","Single Group Assignment","United States|United States","N/A","0",,

The exact effect of H.pylori eradication on prevention of gastric cancer is unclear up to now. To clarify this problem, the investigators conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, population-based study to determine whether H pylori eradication would reduce the incidence of gastric cancer in a high-risk population in China.","Helicobacter Infections|Stomach Neoplasms","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","June 2010","May 2020","OAC triple therapy|Placebo","Drug|Drug","Not Applicable","All","59 Years","30 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","China","Randomized","3000",,

The second trial (named TAITU-A) compares communities randomized to targeted antibiotic treatment versus those randomized to mass antibiotics for trachoma, and the third trial (TAITU-B) compares communities randomized to targeted antibiotics versus those randomized to delayed antibiotics.||SWIFT II is a continuation of the first trial (WUHA I). WUHA I is an ongoing cluster-randomized trial in rural Ethiopia designed to determine the effectiveness of water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) for trachoma. 40 communities were randomized in a 1:1 ratio either to a comprehensive WASH package or to no intervention. The primary outcome is ocular chlamydia, monitored annually for 3 years.||In WUHA II we will treat all 40 WUHA communities with a single mass azithromycin distribution after the month 36 visit, and then continue the WASH intervention only in the 20 communities originally randomized to the WASH arm. We perform annual monitoring visits at months 48, 60, 72, and 84 for the primary outcome of ocular chlamydia among 0-5 year old children. A second aim of WUHA II is to perform a diagnostic test accuracy study of the tests already being conducted as well as several novel tests for trachoma surveillance. The novel tests include inexpensive, point-of-care nucleic acid amplification tests performed on conjunctival swabs, a lateral flow assay for chlamydia seropositivity tested on dried blood spots, and an automated algorithm to detect clinical signs of trachoma from conjunctival photographs. The primary objective of the second aim is to test the sensitivity and specificity of each of these trachoma surveillance tests.||By comparing the combined azithromycin-WASH communities to communities receiving mass azithromycin alone, we investigate the benefit of combining the ""A"", ""F"", and ""E"" components of the SAFE strategy as opposed to focusing on antibiotics alone.

4797,"Completed","Tropical fevers have been a diagnostic challenge from the antiquity. Nowadays, despite the availability of good diagnostic capacities, undifferentiated febrile illnesses continue to be a thorny problem for travel physicians. In developing countries, the scarcity of skilled personnel and adequate laboratory facilities makes the differential diagnosis of fevers even more complex. Health care workers must often rely on syndrome-oriented empirical approaches to treatment and might overestimate or underestimate the likelihood of certain diseases. For instance Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTD) contribute substantially to the burden of persistent (more than 1 week) fevers in the Tropics, causing considerable mortality and major disability. These diseases are however rarely diagnosed at primary health care (PHC) level. The difficulty in establishing the cause of febrile illnesses has resulted in omission or delays in treatment, irrational prescriptions with polytherapy, increasing cost and development of drug resistance.||In resource-limited settings, clinical algorithms constitute a valuable aid to health workers, as they facilitate the therapeutic decision in the absence of good laboratory capacities. There is a critical lack of appropriate diagnostic tools to guide treatment of NTDs. While clinical algorithms have been developed for some NTDs, in most cases they remain empirical. Besides, they rarely take into account local prevalence data, do not adequately represent the spectrum of patients and differential diagnosis at the primary care level and often have not been properly validated.

TB meningitis (TBM), an extrapulmonary form of TB, is the most severe manifestation of paediatric TB. TBM results in high morbidity and mortality in children, despite the availability of chemotherapy, mainly due to diagnostic delay. Most tests required for proper TBM diagnosis including analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain imaging are not available in resource-limited settings e.g., in most of Africa including South Africa. New tests for TBM are urgently needed. The main goal of this proposal is to develop a point-of-care (POC) diagnostic test for TBM, based on CSF and bloodbiomarkers.||Aim 1: Evaluate the diagnostic potentials of 51 host inflammatory biomarkers that the investigators recently identified in CSF and blood samples from children with suspected meningitis in a repository of 100 stored CSF and serum samples using a multiplex platform. After statistical analysis including multi-marker modelling by linear discriminant analysis, random forest, and other modelling techniques, the investigators will select the best combination of up to four biomarkers for incorporation into the prototype diagnostic test (Aim 2).||Aim 2: Incorporate the best performing CSF and serum biomarkers into a novel, patented biosensor-based POC diagnostic test. The investigators will develop a multi-biomarker prototype test for detecting up to 4 biomarkers in serum or CSF.||Aim 3: Evaluate the newly developed POC test on 300 children prospectively.

Tuberculosis (TB) is the foremost cause of infectious deaths globally. In 2025, an additional 1.4 million TB deaths could occur as direct consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is postulated that individuals with latent or active TB are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 disease and that COVID-19 disease rate is high in patients with active TB, although the evidence is still scarce. TB and SARS-CoV-2 are both infectious diseases which primarily attack the alveolar region of the lungs and share common symptoms. SARS-CoV-2 disease can induce innate and adaptive immunity, but uncontrolled inflammatory innate immunity and impaired adaptive immune responses may be associated with severe tissue damage, both locally and systemically. People with coinfection (COVID-19 and TB disease) might potentially have impaired protective immune responses and treatment outcomes, specifically as far as anti-tuberculosis treatment is concerned. However, very little is known about the immunological underpinnings in this interface between TB and COVID-19 on the effect of SARS-CoV-2 disease on disease severity, response to treatment and treatment outcomes in pulmonary tuberculosis.

Development of vaccines has been difficult because shigellae are habitants of and pathogens for humans only and there is no consensus about the mechanism(s) of immunity to this pathogen.||Incomplete, but compelling evidence, indicates that a critical level of serum IgG anti-LPS confers immunity to shigellosis. Important data come from our clinical trial in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recruits. A randomized, double-blind, vaccine-controlled study showed that the S. sonnei-rEPA elicited 74% protection against shigellosis occurring about 3 months after vaccination (p=0.001). This vaccine conferred 43% (p=0.04) protection in one company during an outbreak up to 14 days following vaccination suggesting that our Shigella conjugates might be of value in epidemics. The efficacy of S. sonnei-rEPA was correlated with the level of vaccine-induced IgG antibodies.||The highest incidence, morbidity, and mortality of shigellosis is in young children. But serum antibody responsiveness to polysaccharide-based vaccines is age-dependent and infants and young children respond poorly or not at all to both disease and vaccination. The safety and immunogenicity of these Shigella conjugates in 4 to 6 years-old children in Israel was demonstrated. But although the fold rise in anti-LPS was similar in the children, the level of anti-LPS elicited by the conjugates was lower than in adults. We improved the immunogenicity of Shigella conjugates as shown in mice and then in adult humans.

Pertussis specific antibody titers (anti-Pertussis Toxin, anti-Filamentous haemagglutinin, anti-Pertactin titers) will be monitored in blood samples of the mothers at delivery to measure the possible influence of both gestational age and maternal vaccination status. In order to measure the decline of maternal antibodies in the first weeks of life, blood will be taken from cords as well as from infants at 8 weeks of age, before the first infant pertussis vaccine is administered.||Pertussis antibodies to the same antigens will be measured in all infants after a primary series of acellular pertussis vaccines administered at 8,12 and 16 weeks of age and before and after a booster dose in the second year of life.||In addition, cellular mediated immune responses will be evaluated in a subgroup of infants before and after a primary series of infants vaccines. A last goal is to measure whether vaccination during pregnancy could offer additional maternal antibodies through breast milk. Again a comparison is made between preterm and term born infants, born from either vaccinated or unvaccinated women. The amount of lactoferrin and pertussis toxin specific IgA in breast milk samples will be measured in samples taken at birth (colostrum), and at several time points afterwards as long as breastfeeding is continued.","Pertussis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","January 2015",,"Infant pertussis vaccination","Drug",,"All","40 Years",,,,"Belgium",,"232",,

This study was conducted in three phases, which consisted of a situational analysis using qualitative methods (Phase 1), selecting an appropriate test through evaluating 4 candidate tests and the participatory design and implementation of an intervention that included onsite training, provision of supplies and medicines, quality control and supervision (Phase 2), and an evaluation combining review of record tools, interviews, time motion study and estimating incremental costs (Phase 3). The conceptual framework draws on multilevel assessment (MLA), policy triangle framework, Medical Research Council framework for designing complex interventions and the Normalization Process Model (NPM). Methods included document review, seventy five interviews were conducted with health providers, district managers, facility managers, traditional healers, pregnant women, community health workers, and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGO) managers in phase I and fourteen in phase III, non-participant observation, time-motion study, incremental cost analysis, and sensitivity, specificity and ease of use analysis of four candidate point-of care tests. Data were collected between 2012 and 2014. Qualitative data were analyzed through thematic analysis supported by Nvivo software. Quantitative data were analyzed through descriptive statistics such as frequency, mean and median supported by SPSS. Phase I identified barriers to implementation and uptake of syphilis testing at health provider and community levels. The most important barriers at provider level included fragmentation of services, poor communication between health workers and clients, failure to prescribe syphilis test, and low awareness of syphilis burden. Cost of testing, distance to laboratory and lack of knowledge about syphilis were identified as barriers at community level. Phase II: Alere DetermineTM Syphilis was the most sensitive of the four point-of-care tests evaluated. The components of the intervention were successfully implemented in the selected health facilities. Overall, phase III showed that it is feasible and acceptable to introduce a point of care test for syphilis in antenatal care services at primary health care level using the available staff. The findings suggested that an intervention that introduces point of care test for syphilis at antenatal care services is feasible, acceptable, and of comparable costs to HIV screening in pregnancy. Nonetheless, instructions and supervision need to be clearer to achieve optimal levels of screening and quality control, and barriers identified by health workers need to be overcome. The point-of care test for syphilis is likely to be acceptable by health workers as a routine service and incorporated as a normal practice in Burkina Faso context.","Syphilis Infection|Diagnoses Disease","No","Observational","May 1, 2013","September 30, 2013","Feasibility of introducing onsite test for syphilis in the package of antenatal care at rural primary health care in Burkina Faso","Diagnostic Test",,"Female",,"18 Years",,,,,"1205",,

However, there is insufficient evidence on the optimal dose of rifampin that has similar efficacy as the standard 4-month rifampin regimen without jeopardizing safety or affecting completion rates.||Objectives:||The general purpose of this study is to determine if rifampin at double or triple the standard dose for 2 months is as safe and effective as the standard dose of rifampin when taken for 4 months to treat latent tuberculosis (TB).||Treatment:||Persons who need treatment for latent TB, will be given rifampin, either at the standard dose (10mg/kg/day) for 4 months (control arm); or at double dose (20mg/kg/day) for 2 months (intervention arm 1); or at triple dose (30mg/kg/day) for 2 months (intervention arm 2).||Design:||This is 1:1:1 randomized, phase 2b, partially blind, controlled trial. The two higher doses (intervention arms) will be administered double-blind: participants and providers will be aware of the duration of their regimen, but they will both remain blinded to the specific dose (i.e. 20 or 30 mg/kg/day) for those randomized to 2-months regimens. All members of the same household of a patient with newly diagnosed active pulmonary TB will be randomized together (i.e. cluster randomized).||Population and setting:||Adults and children aged 10 years and above, who have latent TB infection and are recommended by their doctor to take treatment for latent TB can participate in the study.||The planned number of persons with latent TB to recruit is about 1359 in total (or about 453 for each of the three arms).||The study will take place in 6 sites: four in Canada (Calgary, Edmonton, Montreal and Vancouver), one in Indonesia (Bandung) and one in Viet Nam (Ho Chi Min City).||Outcomes:||Primary outcomes are: 1) Treatment completion and 2) Safety (i.e. grade 3-5 adverse events).||Secondary outcomes are: 1) Safety (i.e. grade 1-2 adverse events) and 2) Efficacy (i.e. rates of active TB in the 26 months post-randomization).

4890,"Unknown status","Plague is a severe, life-threatening disease. Plague occurs in focal locations worldwide, but over 95% of human cases reported to WHO are by countries in Africa. The most common clinical manifestations of human infection are bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic plague. Untreated pneumonic or septicemic plague is fatal in over 90% of cases; untreated bubonic plague is fatal in over 50% of cases. Delayed and ineffectual treatment is a main contributor to elevated case fatality rates, which can be as high as 40%, and to the development of pneumonic plague and plague outbreaks.||Streptomycin is considered the treatment of choice, and prompt administration can reduce mortality to 5% or less. However, streptomycin may cause irreversible hearing loss and vestibular damage, reversible renal damage, and it is contraindicated during pregnancy. Tetracyclines, including doxycycline, are considered effective alternatives but they are bacteriostatic and relatively contraindicated for use in children aged < 8 years and pregnant women.||Ciprofloxacin is a relatively newer antimicrobial that is used extensively in clinical practice because of its broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity, excellent tissue and intracellular penetration, suitability for oral administration, and good overall tolerability. In vitro and animal studies suggest equivalent or greater activity of ciprofloxacin against Yersinia pestis when compared with streptomycin or tetracyclines. However, the efficacy of ciprofloxacin for the treatment of human plague has never been demonstrated, nor is it FDA approved for this indication.||Since 2004, CDC has collaborated with the Uganda Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Uganda Virus Research Institute (UVRI) to enhance surveillance, diagnosis, and ecological control of plague in Arua and Nebbi Districts. Through these efforts, we have collected data on over 2,400 cases of clinically diagnosed plague occurring from 1999 through 2009. In 2008, UVRI and CDC staff investigated 163 suspect plague cases: 57 (35%) had laboratory-confirmed plague illness, of which 14 patients (25%) died.||Because plague is a relatively rare disease that mainly affects people living in rural, impoverished areas, it receives limited attention for research and development of affordable and sustainable diagnostic and treatment options. However, because plague cannot be eradicated, and because it causes high case fatality and has the potential for widespread person to person transmission, continued research should not be neglected.||The objective of this clinical trial is to conduct a randomized, open-labeled, non-inferiority study comparing the safety and efficacy of ciprofloxacin to doxycycline, the national treatment standard in Uganda for plague, in patients aged > 8 years. The primary outcome for this trial will be patient outcome 14 days from enrollment and initiation of treatment. Patient outcome will be evaluated only for those patients with laboratory-confirmed plague illness.||Information gathered from this proposed study will help optimize management of naturally occurring plague in humans in many countries of the world, including Uganda and the United States, by providing clinicians with more choices for optimal antimicrobial treatment. This is particularly true in resource limited rural regions such as Uganda where intravenous or intramuscular injections are less available. Ciprofloxacin currently is being used in Uganda and other plague endemic areas of the world for treatment of other infectious conditions, including infectious diarrhea and lower respiratory infections. In Uganda, ciprofloxacin is widely available in health facilities and local drug shops, and is affordable.","Plague","No","Interventional","December 2010",,"ciprofloxacin|doxyxcycline","Drug|Drug","Phase 2","All",,"8 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Uganda","Randomized","200",,

Many people with latent TB will not get sick from it, but some people will develop active TB and become sick. Much is known about how to treat and diagnose active TB, but little is known about the best way to treat latent TB.

4948,"Completed","The investigators aim to evaluate a new potentially cost-effective approach to improving trichiasis surgery outcomes, perioperative topical anti-inflammatory therapy. The investigators hypothesize that adjunctive topical fluorometholone therapy following trichiasis surgery will reduce the risk of recurrent trichiasis. The rationale for this hypothesis is that interruption of inflammation postoperatively would reduce postoperative scarring, leading to better outcomes. As an initial step toward evaluating this modality, the investigators believe it to be necessary to evaluate topical corticosteroid therapy in a safety-oriented study, for which the investigators also hypothesize that fluorometholone will have a perioperative safety profile acceptable for large-scale programmatic use. Topical corticosteroid therapy is associated with potential risks of cataract induction and intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation in susceptible individuals. Fluorometholone has lower intraocular penetration than alternative corticosteroids, with correspondingly less IOP-raising effect while still having favorable effects on conjunctival inflammation, and is a low-cost generic drug. Its poor delivery of corticosteroid into the eye itself provides an advantage in this setting, as the major side effects of therapy are the result of intraocular effects, and therapy only is needed to the conjunctiva. However, prior to use in a large-scale trial it is sensible to make sure adverse outcomes are not observed in a substantial number of TT patients in a smaller scale trial. Secondary goals of such a trial are to evaluate alternative topical corticosteroid dosing schedules to identify an optimal dosing schedule and to identify any preliminary signals of potential efficacy.","Trichiasis|Trachoma|Bilamellar Tarsal Rotation","No","Interventional","November 2013","April 2016","Fluorometholone 0.1% ophthalmic solution|Artificial tears (Placebo)","Drug|Other","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Ethiopia","Randomized","154",,

The frequency of AAD can be high (26 - 60%) or moderate (13-29%) during hospital outbreaks and is relatively infrequent in outpatients. The risk factors for AAD include broad-spectrum antibiotics, host factors (age, health status, and gender), hospitalization period and exposure to nosocomial pathogens. AAD occurs 2-8 weeks after exposure to antibiotics as a result of disrupting normal intestinal microflora. One of the roles of normal intestinal microflora is to act as a protective barrier that resists the colonization of intestinal pathogens. These patients are susceptible to infection by opportunistic pathogens without this protective barrier. Probiotic therapy is suited to AAD and Clostridium difficile disease. Probiotics assist in reestablishing the disrupted intestinal microflora, enhancing immune responses and clearing pathogens and their toxins from the host. Studies using probiotics have been reported for the past twenty-eight years (1977~2005), but the studies have been variable in trial designs and types of probiotics, had differing doses and durations of treatment, and thus have yielded controversial results.

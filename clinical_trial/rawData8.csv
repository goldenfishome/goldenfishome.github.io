While initially confined to the skin, MF may spread to lymph nodes, blood or inner organs, resulting in an overall poor prognosis for the patient. Thus, being a potentially lethal disease, an early and correct diagnosis of MF has very important implications for the patient. However, diagnosis of early MF is often difficult, as it usually shows a close resemblance to benign inflammatory conditions such as eczema and psoriasis. Strikingly, it takes an average of 3-6 (!) years from the appearance of the first skin lesions until a diagnosis of MF can be made. For this reason, a test to distinguishing early MF from benign inflammatory conditions is urgently mandated. By using skin suction blister fluid as well as skin biopsies from patients with MF, eczema and psoriasis, the investigators want to develop a classifier system that can distinguish early MF from benign inflammatory skin diseases.","CTCL/ Mycosis Fungoides",,"Observational","February 22, 2021","June 30, 2024","Skin suction blistering and skin biopsies","Diagnostic Test",,"All","100 Years","18 Years",,,"Austria",,"160",,

7054,"Unknown status","Mycosis fungoides (MF) is an epidermotropic cutaneous T cell lymphoma characterized by the accumulation of CD4+ T-lymphocytes in the skin. Early MF presents as erythematous patches and/or infiltrated plaques. The diagnosis of early MF is a major diagnostic challenge and the differential diagnosis with inflammatory dermatoses is often very difficult. The histopathological diagnosis is also difficult and delayed. Therefore, it is important to develop biomarkers and/or a combination of biomarkers in order to improve the early diagnostic of MF.||In a previous trial, investigators included 490 patients in a study aiming at identifying skin biomarkers of early MF. Several activating and inhibiting KIRs were found to be interesting for the skin diagnostic of MF, mainly KIR2DL4 and KIR3DL2. Investigators later evaluated blood biomarkers in patients with erythrodermic MF and Sezary Syndrome (SS). This French institutional study demonstrated that the identification by PCR of a combination of 4 blood markers (CD158k/KIR3DL2, PLS3/T-Plastin, Twist and NKp46) allowed a reliable diagnosis of lymphoma in erythrodermic patients. This previously published study interestingly showed that 30% to 50% of patients with early MF expressed at least one of these biomarkers in the blood (unpublished data). Other groups also recently showed that TOX can be a diagnostic tool for MF.||The aim of this study is to establishing an accurate blood diagnosis for early suspected MF by demonstrating that newly identified biomarkers or their combination [5 cutaneous KIR receptor markers (KIR2DS1, KIR2DS3, KIR3DL1, KIR2DL4, KIR3DL2) and 5 blood biomarkers (TOX, Twist-1, PLS3/T-plastin, KIR3DL2, NKp46)] are differentially expressed by patients with MF and patients with inflammatory dermatoses closely resembling MF lesions.||Statistical analysis will establish the best combination of blood biomarkers allowing the differentiation between the two groups of patients, combination that could represent a suitable diagnostic tool for early MF.","Cutaneous T Cell Lymphoma","No","Interventional","November 2015","November 2017","Blood sampling","Other","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Diagnostic","Single Group Assignment","France","N/A","620",,

The diagnosis of these lymphomas is difficult using current methods, especially because numerous benign dermatological conditions can mimick CTCL both clinically and under microscopic examination. Recently, the KIR receptor CD158k has been shown to be a marker for Sezary syndrome in both the blood and skin. We hypothesize that other receptors from the same family may help fro the diagnosis of these lymphomas. To address this issue, we will study the expression of all known KIR receptor in the skin of patients presenting with a skin eruption, which may correspond to either a cutaneous T-cell lymphoma or a benign dermatological disease. The final diagnosis will be established by a panel of experts, allowing constitution of 2 groups of patients : the cutaneous T-cell lymphoma group, and the benign inflammatory disease group. The expression of the different KIRs will be analyzed in both group in a blinded fashion, in order to determine whether one or a several KIRs may be differentially expressed.","Mycosis Fungicides|Sezary Syndrome|Dermatitis|Dermatitis, Exfoliative","No","Interventional","March 2009","December 2011","Detection of KIR receptor by RT PCR","Other","Not Applicable","All","95 Years","18 Years","Diagnostic","Single Group Assignment","France","Non-Randomized","495",,

The drug consists of a toxin, called diphtheria toxin, which is attached to an antibody that can specifically target cancerous T-cells. Our primary objectives are, therefore, to determine the patient subgroup with respect to disease burden who best responds to this experimental drug in treating CD3 positive T cell malignancies. We will be determining how the patient and their disease respond to this research agent.||The Clinical Response Data analysis from October 2014 done at the completion of the Phase I portion of A-dmT390-bisFv(UCHT1) fusion protein clinical trial showed that there were 25 evaluable patients who received all 8 doses varying between 2.5 and 11.25 µg/kg per dose. There were responses at all the lower dose levels up to 7.5 µg/kg per dose. The overall response rate was 36% and the complete response rate was 16% (when followed for 6 months). We have identified a subgroup of CTCL patients that have a very high response rate. If we exclude patients whose mSWAT scores never exceeded 50 (50% of skin surface area times a multiplier) and who never had lymph node involvement or stage III disease we are left with 9 patients. This subgroup has an overall response rate of 89% and a complete response rate of 50% (when followed for 6 months). Of these 4 patients currently in complete remission, three are long-term responders. Two are over 6 years in duration and one over 5 years duration. These may represent cures. The long time periods in the transition from partial response to complete response without treatment, 6 months to two years, suggests that the study drug in addition to exerting a direct killing effect on tumor also functions as an immunomodulator.","T-cell Lymphomas|T-cell Leukemia|Sezary Syndrome|Mycosis Fungoides|Cutaneous T-cell Lymphoma (CTCL)","No","Interventional","January 2008","November 2016","A-dmDT390-bisFv(UCHT1)","Biological","Phase 2","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","United States|United States|United States|United States|United States","N/A","32",,

Contact lens wear is the strongest risk factor related to microbial keratitis in developed countries. The most commonly isolated pathogen of contact lens associated microbial keratitis (CLMK) is Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which accounts for over one third of the cases. Among the various virulence factors involved in the pathogenesis of pseudomonal keratitis, a secretion system known as type three secretion system (T3SS) secretes toxins that damage the host cells. ExoS is a bifunctional exotoxin with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity and ADP ribosyl transferase (ADPRT) activity. It results in an invasive phenotype of P. aeruginosa causing a relatively slower host cell death with intracellular invasion and possibly proliferation of bacterium. In contrast, ExoU expressing strains carries a cytotoxic phenotype that causes rapid host cell lysis due to its phospholipase activity. Previously, cytotoxic strains were reported to be more commonly found in patients with pseudomonal keratitis and were highly correlated with multidrug resistance.||In order to understand the pathogenesis of CLMK, especially pseudomonal related CLMK, we proposed to recruit 180 volunteers who will wear different contact lens materials.

For primary TKA, prophylactic antibiotic-loaded cement (ABC) may not only reduce the rate of infection it may also reduce the rate of revisions due to implant loosening. Current controversy about the use of ABC exists around the world. Without a definitive trial, patients will be exposed to a treatment of uncertain efficacy that may cause antibiotic resistant bacterial strains and will certainly generate high costs to the healthcare system. Purpose: To determine, 1) the extent to which ABC compared to regular cement reduces the infection rate in patients over the first two years following TKA and, 2) the resource use implications associated with the use of ABC for TKA. Methods: This is a randomized clinical trial in which 8,800 patients with undergoing primary TKA are allocated to either Simplex™ P with Tobramycin or Simplex™ P bone cement. We will exclude patients with a prior joint infection, an allergy to tobramycin, and those with no fixed address. All patients will be administered IV antibiotics immediately prior to surgery.

Considering that the estimated US prevalence of pediatric bacterial ARTIs is 27% (with the remainder of ARTIs caused by viruses) this represents a substantial degree of antibiotic overuse nationwide. Another troubling trend in antibiotic prescribing for ARTIs in children is the increased reliance on broad-spectrum, second-line agents for bacterial ARTIs.

ERCP is universally performed using a highly specialized type of flexible endoscope called a duodenoscope. Though critical for the successful completion of ERCP, the design of duodenoscopes makes them among the most complicated medical devices that require routine disinfection and reprocessing. In recent years, several ERCP-related infectious outbreaks have occurred.||Thus, it is clear that novel strategies need to be developed in order to prevent future ERCP-related outbreaks. Specialized duodenoscopes with disposable caps have been developed, and these represent a promising new modality with the potential to drastically reduce the rates of duodenoscope-related infection.||Research Questions & Objectives||There are two co-primary outcomes in this study; the first is to determine the clinical efficacy of a novel duodenoscope with a disposable elevator cap (DEC) system compared with a duodenoscope with a traditional design. The second co-primary objective is to determine the rate of persistent pathogenic contamination of the novel duodenoscope following standardized disinfection and reprocessing protocols compared with a traditional duodenoscope.||Methods||This is a prospective, consecutive, randomized controlled study. The intervention arm will comprise use of the ED34-i10T2 duodenoscope with DEC, along with any required standard ERCP accessories, whereas the control arm will comprise use of the ED34-i10T duodenoscope with any required ERCP accessories. All procedures will be performed by expert endoscopists with adequate training, or by advanced endoscopy trainees under direct supervision.||Collected data will include primary endpoints listed above, in addition to patient demographics, endoscopist and trainee data, sedation used, procedural details, and peri-procedural data.

The investigators have confirmed in our previous work that intraoperative bacterial transmission events occur frequently both within and between surgical cases and that these transmission events are linked to 30-day postoperative HCAIs and increased patient mortality.||In response, the investigators have implemented various strategies designed to bacterial transmission in the operating room, including anesthesia provider hand hygiene compliance.

These studies have shown that controversy exists over which antiseptic skin preparation is the most effective for preventing postoperative surgical wound infections. The standard of care at Los Angeles County Hospital for preoperative skin antiseptic in cesarean sections is povidone- iodine 10% (betadine), however many other hospitals have made the transition to using Chloraprep. In an attempt to improve on the current standard of care, we propose a quality improvement prospective randomized study to compare the difference in postoperative wound complications with the use of povidone- iodine and Chloraprep as a preoperative antiseptic in cesarean sections.

7146,"Completed","Joint replacement is becoming an increasingly common procedure. In 2005, 534,000 total knee arthroplasties (TKA) were performed in the United States which is at a rate of 18.1 per 10,000 individuals, and the demand for primary TKA is projected to grow by 673% by 2030. Effective post-operative analgesia is an important component with regards to patient satisfaction and hospital stay. Regional anesthesia has been shown to decrease duration of surgery, need for transfusion, post-operative nausea and vomiting, and the incidence of thromboembolic disease in patients undergoing total knee or total hip replacement when compared with general anesthesia. Post-operatively, regional anesthesia has been shown to reduce pain scores and/or morphine consumption as well as opioid-related adverse effects.||Epidural catheter or spinal anesthesia has become the standard of care at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for intraoperative management of TKA patients. General anesthesia is still occasionally used for patients that would strongly prefer a general anesthetic, those that are taking anticoagulation medications or with a coagulopathy, those with previous back surgery, and those with certain neurologic conditions such as multiple sclerosis or spina bifida. Comparison studies between lumbar epidural analgesia and femoral nerve catheters (FNC) for postoperative analgesia following TKA show no significant difference in pain scores, morphine consumption, or post-operative nausea and vomiting. However, epidural analgesia has been associated with higher incidence of hypotension and urinary retention. FNC's placed for postoperative pain allow patients to ambulate more effectively as there should not be much of a lower extremity motor block. Patients with a FNC for postoperative analgesia also do not require a urinary catheter which eliminates a common source of infection in postoperative patients. FNCs have also demonstrated improved rehabilitation times and decreased hospital stays which has led to an increased insertion rate of FNCs for postoperative analgesia following TKA at the University of Wisconsin.||Pyarthrosis is a fairly common complication occurring at a rate of 2% following primary and 5.6% following revision TKA. Infection can be a devastating complication following implantation of joint hardware often leading to extended hospitalization/rehabilitation stays and return trips to the operating room. The average billed charges for all types of revision TKA procedures was $49,360 with average length of stay of 5.1 days. Indwelling lines are a known infection risk and indwelling lines in the femoral region are known to be associated with a high incidence of catheter colonization. At 48 hours, Cuvillon et. al. found that 57% of FNCs placed without the use of a chlorhexidine impregnated patch had positive bacterial colonization. They also described three cases of transient bacteremia secondary to FNCs in the 208 catheters that they analyzed.||Chlorhexidine impregnated patches also known as ""biopatches"" have been shown to reduce the incidence of bacterial colonization and infection of various indwelling lines including epidurals and central venous catheters. Currently no standard of care exists that requires the use of biopatches for FNCs. The investigators propose studying the use of the biopatch to reduce the incidence of bacterial colonization of femoral nerve catheters.||The investigators will study the efficacy of the biopatch at decreasing the rate of bacterial colonization of FNCs in TKA patients. The FNCs will be inserted in the standard fashion and removed at the end of therapy. Typically the FNC infusion will continue until the morning of post-operation day (POD) #1 or 2. The process for FNC insertion first involves sterile prep and drape of the femoral region. Full sterile technique will be utilized including gown, gloves, and mask. Ultrasound guidance is then commonly utilized to identify the femoral nerve. Following patient sedation and skin infiltration with local anesthetic, a tuohy needle is inserted adjacent to the femoral nerve. A catheter is then threaded through the needle in close proximity to the femoral nerve. Patients will be randomized to either no chlorhexidine impregnated patch or to a chlorhexidine impregnated patch that will be located at the catheter exit site. On the morning of POD 1 or 2, the FNC infusion will be discontinued. Typically, Twenty-four to forty-eight hours after catheter insertion, it will be removed in a sterile fashion and the skin surrounding the catheter exit site will be swabbed and the distal catheter tip will be sent for culture to determine bacterial colonization. In addition, the investigators will interview patients and review clinical data to determine signs of infection and/or catheter tip colonization rates.","Catheter Infections|Spinal Catheter (Epidural) (Subdural); Complications, Infection or Inflammation","No","Interventional","August 2011","April 2012","Chlorhexidine impregnated patch (Biopatch)","Device","Phase 4","All","85 Years","18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","United States","Randomized","100",,"0|0"
7147,"Recruiting","Background: Vascular grafts are increasingly implanted due to an increasing prevalence of atherosclerosis and diabetes, and about 1-6% of vascular procedures are complicated by infection. Mortality attributable to prosthetic vascular graft infections (PVGI) is high. However, there are almost no data regarding best treatment options of such complicated infections. Most recommendations are based on expert opinion and not on clinical trials or cohort observational data analyses. Evaluating infectious and other complications after vascular surgery procedures are important, and additionally, such studies may offer insights for quality improvement and improved patient outcomes. With the first aim investigators will establish an infrastructure for studying PVGI in Zurich. Investigators will take advantage of the Swissvasc registry, a central registry which collects preoperative, operative and discharge data regarding the index vascular surgical interventions. They will create a prospective observational cohort database of all patients who receive a vascular graft (peripheral, aortic, vein) at the University hospital of Zurich (VASGRA Cohort A). Patients with a PVGI will be included in VASGRA Cohort B and followed up using a flow chart with a focus on the course of this infectious complication. Additionally, investigators will establish a biobank with the collection of tissue- and blood samples of patients with PVGI. With the second aim researchers will investigate different diagnostic, clinical and therapeutic research questions nested in the VASGRA Cohort. Firstly, they will address epidemiological questions, such as: determine the incidence and outcome of complications after vascular graft placement; determine risk factors, best treatment strategies and outcome of PVGI, and determine the influence of different antibiotic regimens on the outcome of PVGI due to different bacterial pathogens. Secondly, investigators will determine the accuracy of different imaging techniques (PET/CT and MRI) for the diagnosis of PVGI, and their individual role for the assessment of treatment response. Thirdly, investigators will evaluate the bacterial diversity of vascular wound infections using 16s r-Ribonucleic acid (RNA)amplification, and investigators will explore whether this bacterial diversity does predict disease progression. Here, investigators will also study the impact of negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) on bacterial diversity in the treatment course of PVGI. Fourthly, investigators will look for cut-off levels of relevant blood leucocytes count, C-reactive protein and procalcitonin raising suspicion of a PVGI. Lastly, investigators will look at histopathological features of excised vascular grafts. Expected value of the project: Results from the proposed study are an important contribution to the field, based on the large sample size, longitudinal design and by unifying clinical and epidemiological science. The very well characterized patient groups and the close connection between vascular surgeons, infectious disease specialists, specialists in nuclear medicine and microbiologist will help to investigate PVGI in depths. Investigators hope to be able to develop guidelines regarding best diagnostic modalities and treatment options in case of vascular graft infections. In the future we plan to examine bacteria retrieved from the PVGI in the laboratory in detail. The recovered bacteria will be examined for antimicrobial susceptibility and their capability to form biofilms. Furthermore investigators will examine how bacterial recovery form explanted grafts could be optimized.","Prosthetic Vascular Graft Infection","No","Observational","May 2013","March 2023","Prosthetic vascular graft","Device",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Switzerland",,"1800",,

Oral bacterial communities have been extensively studied over the last decade both in normal and pathological states; however, little data are available on the possibility to modify microbiota composition in a controlled and 'non-aggressive' manner by using probiotics, in order to improve oral health.||Saliva contains microorganisms attached to exfoliated human cells and released from oral biofilms; its microbiota is most similar (proportionally) to those of the dorsal and lateral tongue. In addition, bacteria belonging to genera Porphyromonas, Tannerella and Treponema, which contain species associated with periodontitis, are consistently identified in saliva. Salivary microbial communities are relatively stable and thus potentially interesting as an indicator of oral and general health. Indeed, it has been suggested that interventions aimed at improving oral health should target mucosal microbiota (to which saliva is most similar) in addition to dental microbial communities. Whole saliva also constitutes an alternative to gingival crevicular fluid when analysing analytes present in periodontal pockets. It has been suggested that saliva reflects a consensus inflammatory status of the whole mouth with potentially significant clinical relevance.||Strain K12 of Streptococcus salivarius is available internationally as a food supplement, notably for oral hygiene. Several studies investigated the effectiveness of S. salivarius as a probiotic in the context of pharyngeal infections, halitosis, plaque formation and caries.

7211,"Completed","The overall objective is to determine the influence of timing of ART initiation and alcohol consumption on HIV disease course, including detailed analysis of important events occurring shortly after HIV acquisition. ART initiation immediately after HIV infection (during Fiebig stages I-II) largely results in smaller HIV reservoir and lower HIV-associated systemic inflammation, which has been linked to non-AIDS morbidity and mortality. Immediate ART also reduces HIV-associated bacterial translocation and may prevent dysbiosis, an alteration of the intestinal microbiota that has been linked to increased systemic inflammation. Immediate intervention is not, however, generally feasible and more information is required about the consequences of starting ART at later time-points, but still early after acquisition. The proposed study will be conducted in Lima, Peru, in the cohort of 180 MSM with acute (Ab-, HIV RNA+) or recent (≤ 3 months) HIV infection. Alcohol use disorder is present in ~50% of HIV-infected MSM in our cohort, which is four times higher than that seen among males in the general Peruvian population. Although the role of alcohol use in HIV pathogenesis and disease course remains unclear, some studies show a correlation with accelerated disease progression. In animal models and clinical studies, both acute and chronic alcohol consumption have been linked to bacterial translocation and activation of the innate immune system, which can lead to increases in pro-inflammatory cytokines. The effects of alcohol resemble early post-infection changes in bacterial translocation and pro-inflammatory cytokines induced by HIV and their impact on HIV disease course before and after ART initiation remain unexplored.||Specific Aim 1: To determine the relative long-term benefits of immediate vs. early vs. delayed ART initiation. The investigators will study outcomes after 2 and 4 years in MSM diagnosed with acute or recent HIV infection. The investigators will examine outcomes in 3 groups based on time of ART initiation: a) immediate: during FI-II (N~30), b) early: during FIII-V (N~50) or c) delayed: at 24 weeks after diagnosis (N~80). The investigators anticipate that CD4+ T cell counts and peripheral inflammatory markers in the FIII-V group and the delayed group will approach those in the immediate treatment group (FI-II) over time; in contrast, they expect that those started ART at ""early"" or ""delayed"" time points will have persistent changes in the GI microbiome and in the HIV reservoir.||Specific Aim 2: To determine the impact of alcohol use on the relative long-term benefits of immediate vs. early vs. delayed initiation of ART. The investigators will examine the impact of alcohol use on critical events in HIV infection. They hypothesize that dose-dependent alcohol-induced changes will compound the negative effects of HIV and lead to greater levels of dysbiosis and inflammation, higher early plasma HIV RNA, and greater ""seeding"" and persistence of HIV DNA in participants with high-level alcohol use. The investigators will assess viral load, GI microbiome and metagenomics, pro-inflammatory cytokines, production of msRNA and analyze the impact on alcohol use in all subjects prior to ART initiation and among ART-adherent participants with persistent viral suppression.","HIV Infection","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","August 28, 2017","November 30, 2020","ART initiation at time of HIV diagnosis|ART at 24 weeks","Drug|Drug","Not Applicable","Male",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Peru","Randomized","216",,

Up to 25% of NB patients on CIC suffer from RUTI and daily, low-dose antibiotic prophylaxis is widely prescribed to prevent these infections. Unfortunately, this therapeutic option is not evidence-based and can be associated with a higher risk of RUTI secondary to development of antibiotic resistance. In addition, many children suffer from a range of adverse reactions and emergence of drug resistant organisms. Moreover, recent studies have shown that antibiotics cause a major disruption in the human microbiome, potentially leading to long term major problems.||Probiotics are live microorganisms, which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. There is evidence that probiotics restore microbial homeostasis in the vagina, reduce the risk of pathogen ascension into the bladder, and modulate immunity to better protect the host. Probiotic strains, including Lactobacillus rhamnosus GR-1, Lactobacillus reuteri B-54 and RC-14, have been shown to be safe and efficacious in an oral formulation or as a vaginal suppository in improving the microbiota profile of the vagina and decreasing the risk of RUTI. Various mechanisms appear to be involved, including modulating antimicrobial and inflammatory defenses, up-regulating protective mucin production and reducing the pressure on pathogens to acquire antibiotic resistance genes. A randomized trial comparing probiotics to antibiotic prophylaxis in children with vesicoureteric reflux showed equivalent reduction in the incidence of RUTI and development of new renal scarring. In addition, down regulation of inflammatory cytokines can potentially favorably alter bladder function and prevent bladder fibrosis.||Investigators at London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) have the opportunity to acquire clinical data that would strengthen the case for probiotics to be integrated into pediatric urology practice for managing CIC and RUTI.

In the case of SBP, early diagnosis and rapid therapeutic care can improve patient survival (Garcia-Tsao, 2001).||The diagnosis of SBP is based on the detection of a polymorphonuclear neutrophils count equal to or greater than 250 /mm3 in the ascitic fluid (method of reference). However, obtaining an ascitic cell count is sometimes difficult because it can not always be performed in emergency especially outside the opening hours of the laboratory of Bacteriology. This raises the necessity of developing quick and easy alternative approaches of diagnosis.||Few groups have proposed the use of urinary reagent strip for rapid diagnosis of SBP. Nevertheless, the investigators clinical teams have shown that the sensitivity of this test was low in a large national multicenter prospective study involving more than a thousand patients (Nousbaum et al., 2007). The use of Multistix strips test is thus not recommended for the routine application of diagnosis of SBP due to its lack of sensitivity.||Although performed on small groups of patients, several studies have reported that IL-8 or IL-6 might be used as markers of ascitic fluid infections. Based on these data and confirmed by the investigators preliminary results the investigators propose to study on a broad recruitment of patients estimated to about 500 inclusions (about 45 infected patients) the interest of using IL-8 and IL-6 as predictive markers of SBP.

This is a protein hormone involved in the inflammatory and immune responses (Otero et al., 2005).

7247,"Unknown status","Background:||Helicobacter pylori infection, which affects over 50% of the global population, is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases in the world. H. pylori infection causes chronic active gastritis and is associated with peptic ulcer, lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue and gastric cancer. The colonization of H. pylori in the hostile gastric environment is determined by the complex interactions among bacterial, environmental and host factors. Because of the emergence of antibiotic resistance and adverse drug reactions such as diarrhea, the successful rates with standard triple therapy for H. pylori eradication are falling.||Vitamin D or its analogues was found to induce autophagy in keratinocytes, macrophages, and various cancer cell types. Our preliminary findings indicated that 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 could induce cathelicidin expression and autophagy in cultured human gastric epithelial HFE-145 cells and reduced the intracellular survival of H. pylori in a co-culture system. It was also found that cathelicidin alone reduced the survival of drug-resistant strain of H. pylori. 1α,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 also significantly reduced H. pylori colonization in mice, perhaps through the induction of cathelicidin in the stomach. These findings suggest that vitamin D not only could control H. pylori but also its drug-resistant strains in humans.||Emerging evidence suggest that vitamin D might be a cost-effective prophylactic and possibly therapeutic antimicrobial agent for the control and eradication of H. pylori. Since vitamin D acts through mechanisms independent of standard antibiotics, it is expected that vitamin D will be equally efficacious for controlling and eradicating drug-resistant strains of H. pylori. The investigators herein propose that vitamin D in combination of standard antimicrobial therapeutics could improve the eradication rates of drug-resistant H. pylori.","H.

These conditions were due, in general, immaturity and all ""inexperience"" of the immune system, as well as to the particular anatomical structure and function of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract still developing. This inevitably means that school-age children develop disease (as a result of infection) more easily than at later ages. The frequency and duration of these conditions implies a high discomfort and incur significant costs in relation to drug administration, the need for hospitalization, days of absence from school and work days lost by parents.||Recently probiotics, defined as ""microorganisms that prove able, once ingested in adequate amounts, exert beneficial functions for the body ""have been proposed for the treatment of treatment of respiratory and gastrointestinal infections of childhood but only in recent years have been conducted controlled clinical trials that have conclusively proven effectiveness. All probiotics induce an immune response, the characteristics of which are related to the strain or the mixture of bacteria used. Recent studies have demonstrated positive effects of probiotics on the respiratory system, and in particular on the prevention and reduction of the severity of respiratory infections, probably mediated by an increase of cells that secrete Immunoglobulin A in bronchial mucosa. It 'been shown that probiotics can be a sure way to reduce the risk of early acute otitis media and the use of antibiotics for recurrent respiratory infections during the first year of life. Similar results were seen in a study conducted on a population of 326 children aged between 3 and 5 years, who found a decrease in the incidence of antibiotic use by over 65% and a reduction of days of absence of more than 25% among children treated with a probiotic. Many of the studied effects of probiotics, understandably, refer to the digestive system. These effects relate to both conditions paraphysiological (constipation) and more specifically in situations of illness.||Most of the studies carried out in recent years has demonstrated the efficacy of specific probiotics in reducing the symptoms in the pediatric population affected by infectious gastroenteritis. Probiotics reduce the duration of infectious diarrhea by 0.7 days and reduce the frequency of diarrheal episodes in the first few hours.||The microbiota on the other hand participates in the function of the mucosal barrier against the adhesion of pathogenic bacteria, crucial time for the start of the infectious process.||When this barrier function is altered by chemical agents, by antigens or by stressors of different nature, may manifest intestinal disorders, sometimes due to the growth of bacteria pathogens. Numerous experimental data suggest that probiotics can contribute to the reinforcement of the activities of gut mucosal barrier, in particular aspects affecting the functionality of the intestinal epithelial cells or macrophages.||More recently it has been shown that daily intake for 3 months of preparation with probiotics reduce the incidence and severity of the most common respiratory infections and limits the number of days of absence school children during the winter season.||It's scientifically recognized as some probiotic effects can also be obtained with the use of inactivated bacteria or bacterial components isolated (eg bacterial DNA).

The benefits are attributable to bacterial components that remain in the final product (for example, DNA, cell wall, etc.) and factors produced during the fermentation (short chain fatty acids, bacterial proteins, etc.).||The main effects of these bacterial components relate to the stimulation of the gastrointestinal tract associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), through interaction with the immune cells via Toll-like receptors.||In addition, some components, such as proteins and peptides, may have a Bifidogenic activity and are available in the literature some studies that have demonstrated the ability of infant formula, milk-based fermented to reduce the severity of episodes of infectious diarrhea in children.||With this data, the Commission of the European Society of Nutrition Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Pediatric Nutrition (ESPGHAN) has defined this type of products are not only safe but to determine a potential prebiotic effect and the reduction of the severity of episodes of infectious diarrhea.","Gastrointestinal Infections|Respiratory Infections","No","Interventional","February 2013","June 2013","fermented milk|fermented rice","Dietary Supplement|Dietary Supplement","Phase 3","All","48 Months","12 Months","Prevention","Factorial Assignment","Italy","Randomized","405",,

While most of the research on SSI focused on minimizing any source of pathogens at the time of the surgery, emerging evidence shows how acute and chronic SSI can emerge more often from bacteraemia or other tissues in the body, such as the gastrointestinal system, especially when dysbiosis and high permeability are retrieved.||Intercellular tight junctions (TJs) tightly regulate paracellular antigen trafficking. TJs are extremely dynamic structures that operate in several critical functions of the intestinal epithelium under both physiological and pathological circumstances. This paradigm was subverted in 1993 by the discovery of zonula occludens 1 (ZO-1) as the first component of the TJ complex 11 now being comprised of more than 150 proteins, including occludin, claudins, junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), tricellulin , and angulins .

The germs most frequently found are Streptococcus B (SB) for term newborns (> 37 Weeks of Amenorrhea SA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli) in premature newborns. Although in France, its incidence of 0.4 / 1000 is lower than in other developed countries (0.8 / 1000 general incidence), it remains a major public health concern.||The infection criteria were defined by the National Agency for Health Accreditation and Assessment (ANAES) in 2002, allowing to differentiate between proven infections and highly probable cases of infection. Infection is considered to be proven when SB or E. coli is detected in blood culture or in cerebrospinal fluid. An infection is considered to be highly probable in the event of association of clinical signs (fever, polypnea, desaturation, tachycardia, etc.) evoking a beginning sepsis associating with a disturbance of the biological balance sheet (elevation of CRP, hyperleukocytosis, evidence of colonization on peripheral samples). These criteria remain valid to this day to define the infection.||In order to define the newborns to be monitored, risk factors were established after a review of the literature in 2002. They make it possible to decide on diagnostic management and / or the setting up of a treatment.||Since the recommendations of the ANAES of 2002, the rule, from the presence of a major criterion, was to carry out bacteriological samples peripheral to the birth (gastric liquid, swab of ear and anus) and to systematically collect a CRP of the child between H12 and H48. In the presence of an isolated minor risk factor, simple clinical monitoring (routine) was recommended for 48 hours without deciding firmly on the need for a biological sample. However, it is important to note that these two categories of signs are defined and classified in descending order of risk. This classification does not prejudge a systematic therapeutic attitude. In many situations, the choice is actually left to the practitioner depending on the context.||In 2017, new recommendations were implemented by the French Society of Pediatrics (SFP) and the French Society of Neonatology (SFN) regarding the prevention of INBP. These take up the risk factors of the 2002 ANAES by adding PCR SB at the same level as the traditional PV. They define 3 categories of children according to the risk of INBP and the associated care.||In most cases, these new practices make it possible to dispense with costly blood and bacteriological samples, which cause discomfort and pain for children. In addition, the use of gastric fluid is not internationally validated, its use in the management case remains very controversial. In case of delayed CRP or positive peripheral samples to the germs generated, and even in the absence of clinical signs, antibiotic therapy was almost systematically initiated. Unnecessary exposure to antibiotics promotes the development of bacteriological resistance and unbalances the neonatal flora.||Following the implementation of these new recommendations at the Notre Dame de Bon Secours maternity hospital, which is the case in few centers today and no national survey has yet been carried out on their application, it therefore seems necessary to us evaluate the application of these new recommendations and verify that they allow the detection of all probable or proven infections.","Newborn","No","Observational","August 9, 2020","December 31, 2021",,,,"All",,"36 Weeks",,,"France",,"954",,

Thus, in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), these catheters are widely used in situations when more than peripheral venous access is necessary. This central access allows the delivery of fluids, e.g, blood, medications, etc. as well as serves as a means to withdraw blood. It has been estimated that more than 250,000 nosocomial bloodstream infections occur each year, with 90% of these associated with the use of CVCs.

The cost of treating CVC related BSI has been estimated to be in excess of $28,000 per catheter. In the adult medical literature, there is strong evidence supporting use of antiseptic or antibiotic coated catheters to reduce the cost of hospitalization for CVC related infections.

In the most recent report from our center the incidence was 36.6% during the first 6 months after transplantation.||The clinical consequence in the graft survival and the association with immunological rejection has not been well defined. Nevertheless, the association of UTI with high rate of hospitalization and their costs are widely recognized. There is paucity of trials, specially randomized and controlled, comparing antibiotic prophylaxis in this group of patients. In a recently published metaanalysis Green et al. (Transpl Infect Dis. 2011 Oct;13(5):441-7) found only 6 clinical trials well designed, the conclusion was that antibiotic prophylaxis reduced the incidence of UTI and the risk of sepsis. Based in this information, the KDIGO guidelines in transplantation recommend the prophylaxis for UTI with sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (SMT). Nevertheless, the rate of bacterial resistance to SMT has been reported above 50% in almost all the series.||Fosfomycin-trometamol (FT) is a wall antibiotic (piruvil-tranferase inhibitor) that has shown a good bioavailability, especially in the urinary tract. It has shown a wide antibacterial spectrum, but the important target seems to be enteric bacilli particularly Escherichia coli (the most prevalent cause of UTI). FT has also shown a very good activity against E. coli producer of Extended Spectrum Betalactamases. Recently, the rate of these multi-drug resistant bacteria has increased in our center as evidence of worldwide distribution. In addition, the rate of FT resistance has been stable during the last years (<3%). This phenomenon could be explained because of the properties of this antibiotic, the most important one seems to be related with the unique mechanism of action and the lack to propagate the mechanisms of resistance at least in E. coli. There is only one clinical trial (randomized and controlled), which compared FT with placebo in UTI prophylaxis; 317 women with recurrent UTI (three by year) were included. They found rates of 0.14 and 2.9 episodes/patient/year, respectively (p<0.001). Furthermore, there was no FT resistance during the follow up.||Our hypothesis is that in the first six months after kidney transplantation, UTI prophylaxis with FT will show greater efficacy in comparison with SMT. Considering the incidence of UTI in our center (36.6%) and the rate of UTI in the unique trial of prophylaxis with FT (14%), 65 patients will be needed by group of treatment to demonstrate a difference of 22% in the incidence of UTI, with a power of 80% and confidence level of 95%. The primary outcome is the incidence and rate of UTI during the first six months after kidney transplantation. The secondary outcomes are, the hospitalization rate, antibiotic resistance rate, rejections and titer and number of de novo donor specific antibodies.||The investigators propose a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial to compare FT with SMT in the efficacy and safety to prevent UTI during the first six months after kidney transplantation. The investigators will include patients from two tertiary-care transplant centers. Recruiting and the randomization will be carried out separately by center and gender (because female patients have a greater risk of UTI). The medical visits will be scheduled monthly and include general laboratory, urine culture and information gathering about antibiotic side effects as well as adherence. Rejection rate and the number and titers of de novo donor specific antibodies (secondary outcome) will be obtained according to the standard of care of the institutional kidney transplantation follow up.

While up to the early 1980's perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in maxillofacial surgery was controversial, its efficacy is well accepted today. Chole and his team could show that the administration of antibiotics one hour preoperatively and eight hours after the intervention reduces the incidence of infectious complications in facial fractures from 42,2% to 8.9%. However there is still no consensus about the duration of the postoperative administration. In literature postoperative prophylaxis in facial fractures varies from single-shot 6-7 up to a duration of 7 and even ten days postoperatively 8-10. The use of antibiotics can be associated with allergic or toxic reactions, adverse effects, drug interactions and increasing bacterial resistance. In addition some authors assume that a prolonged administration of antibiotics might increase the risk of infectious complications via superinfection.

When a gastrointestinal organ is the source of pathogens, gram-negative bacilli (e.g., E. coli) are typical isolates, which are susceptible to gentamicin.

This virus has spread rapidly among the nations of the world and it is the cause of a pandemic and a global health emergency. There is still very little scientific evidence on the virus, however epidemiological data suggest that one of the most frequent comorbidities is diabetes, along with hypertension and heart disease. There is no scientific evidence on the possible effects of this infection on the function of the β cell and on glycemic control. Clinical evidence seems to suggest that COVID-19 infection mostly affects the respiratory system, and an acute worsening of glycemic compensation is not described as generally observed in bacterial pneumonia. However, previous work on acute respiratory syndromes (SARS) caused by similar coronaviruses, had described that the infection has multi-organ involvement related to the expression of the SARS coronavirus receptor, the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme, in different organs, especially at the level of endocrine pancreatic tissue. In the population of this previous work, glucose intolerance and fasting hyperglycaemia have been described and in 37 of 39 diabetic patients examined, a remission of diabetes was observed three years after the infection. It is possible that the coronaviruses responsible for SARS may enter the pancreatic islets using the angiotensin 2 converting enzyme receptor, expressed at the level of the endocrine pancreas, thus causing diabetes.

7318,"Completed","It has recently been discovered that bacteria are able to communicate using specialised molecules known as Quorum Sensing Signalling Molecules (QSSMs). An accumulation of QSSMs in their surrounding environment allow for the bacteria to quantify the size of colonies. At specific colony sizes the concentration of QSSMs reaches a critical threshold leading to the activation of genes that cause an infection. It is by this mechanism that bacteria within a colony coordinate behaviour to activate infectivity when colony sizes are large enough to withstand defensive measures from the host's immune system. A disruption of quorum sensing may reduce the severity of infection and this has led to the development of inhibitors of quorum sensing as a new strategy in antibacterial therapy.||QSSMs are also thought to facilitate infection by other mechanisms and are able to influence the number and function of a specific type of immune cell known as an 'antigen presenting cell'. These cells are pivotal in allowing the immune system to recognise components of bacteria as foreign and thereby mount the appropriate response. It was found that large numbers of these types of cells underwent programmed cell death (cell suicide) in the presence of QSSMs compared to when QSSMs were absent. This mirrors the situation in blood sampled from patients with severe infections where there is a greater proportion of cell deaths among antigen presenting cells than other types of immune cell.||This study aims to establish in healthy volunteers, the mechanisms by which QSSMs affect immune cells and facilitate the spread of infection. Antibiotic administration in humans can alter the environment of the intestine and can lead to an overgrowth of harmful bacteria to potentially cause an infection. Probiotics supplements can prevent bacterial overgrowth and potentially reduce infective complications.

While estimates vary, surgical site infections complicate up to 5 - 10% of all cesarean sections and result in significant human suffering and excess health care costs. Interventions such as preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduce surgical site infections by 60%, but the rate of infection remains high. There is therefore a great need to identify and test other potential interventions to further reduce these infections.||The skin is a major source of pathogens that cause surgical site infection. Therefore, optimizing preoperative skin antisepsis has the potential to decrease postoperative surgical site infections. There is paucity of evidence to guide the choice of antiseptic for skin preparation at cesarean section. To date, only two underpowered trials have been published comparing two methods of preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section. A recent randomized trial in adults undergoing clean-contaminated mostly general surgical procedures demonstrated a 41% reduction in surgical site infection with the use of chlorhexidine-alcohol when compared to the more commonly used povidone-iodine. While it is plausible that findings from trials in other clean-contaminated surgical procedures may apply to cesarean sections, physiological changes in pregnancy, the peculiar dual microbial source for cesarean-related infections and the hormone-mediated immune-modulation in pregnancy make the validity of such extrapolation uncertain.||The study has the following specific aims:||Primary Aim: To test the hypothesis that preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation at cesarean section significantly reduces surgical site infections compared to iodine-alcohol.||Secondary Aim 1: To test the hypothesis that preoperative chlorhexidine-alcohol skin preparation at cesarean section significantly reduces bacterial contamination at the surgical site compared to iodine-alcohol.||Secondary Aim 2: To determine clinical outcomes and medical costs associated with cesarean-related infections and quantify potential cost savings attributable to use of chlorhexidine-alcohol for preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section.","Surgical Site Infections","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","September 2011","June 2015","Iodine-alcohol|Chlorhexidine-alcohol","Drug|Drug","Not Applicable","Female",,,"Prevention","Parallel Assignment","United States","Randomized","1147","0|0","0|0"

It is estimated to be responsible for 27% to 47% of ICU-acquired infections.||The pathogenesis of VAP is complex but typically involves colonization of the aerodigestive tract with pathogenic bacteria, the formation of biofilms, and microaspiration of contaminated secretions. Preventing carriage of potentially pathogenic micro-organisms from the aerodigestive tract is an infection control strategy used to reduce the occurrence of VAP. One novel intervention is the administration of prophylactic probiotics which restore non-pathogenic flora that compete with pathogens, modulate local and systemic immunity, and decrease intestinal permeability and thus can be beneficial in preventing nosocomial infections in critically ill patients. The role of the probiotics in preventing VAP in mechanically ventilated patients is inconclusive. Some evidence indicates that probiotics may reduce the incidence of VAP by inhibiting pathogen adhesion, improving gut mucosal barrier function, reducing bacterial translocation and up-regulating the immune system. Furthermore, guidelines remain inconclusive regarding the role of commensal oropharyngeal flora (COF) as a causative agent in VAP, mainly due to a scarcity of studies in this research field.

Since antibiotics are designed to fight planktonic free-living bacteria, studying antibiotic resistance in biofilm communities poses a paradigm shift.

The technique probably has a great potential in surgical gastroenterology, urology and gynaecology.||The technique is based on the idea of minimally invasive surgery. The human organism is affected by a stress response when exposed to surgery. This stress response can be minimized by reducing the size of the openings whereby the surgeon gains access to the organs. This affects how quickly a patient recovers after surgery and can be discharged and resumes daily life and work. The same principal have been responsible for the surgical evolution in the last 15-20 years where many procedures have gone from traditional open operations with large incisions in the abdominal wall to laparoscopic surgery with cameras through small holes in the abdominal wall.||The latest addition to minimal invasive surgery is NOTES. Here the surgeon gains access to the abdominal organs with flexible endoscopes through the body's natural openings i.e. the mouth and stomach. With this technique the surgeon avoids cutting through skin and muscle of the abdominal wall, thus minimizing the surgical stress response. This minimizes postoperative pain, the incidence of incisional hernias, eliminates wound infection, and properly prevents scar tissue formation inside the abdominal cavity which way lead to ileus. The end result is a quicker discharge and a better cosmetic result.||It has been shown in numerous animal studies that NOTES is feasible and in recent years a rapidly increasing number of published patient series.||However, there is a risk of infection associated with accessing the abdominal cavity through a natural body opening, which initially is unclean and can not be disinfected in the same way as the skin of the abdominal wall.||Numerous microbiological pig studies have shown that there is transfer of bacteria from the body opening (i.e. mouth) to the abdominal cavity when performing NOTES, but this contamination have no correlation to infection after surgery, neither in terms of healing or survival.||It is unclear from the literature whether patients should be offered proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy to reduce the acidity of the stomach before NOTES interventions. The rationale has been that such a treatment can make the gastric juices less acidic and thereby reduce the incidence of chemical peritonitis, which can occur when acidic juices flows from the stomach and into the abdominal cavity. It is known however that the acidic environment of the stomach provides a natural barrier for bacteria. Making the gastric juices less acidic could potentially increase the risk of bacterial peritonitis.||It is known that the bacterial content of the stomach is low due the acidic environment but bacteria passed down from the mouth and throat with the endoscope could potentially result in bacterial peritonitis.||That bacteria from the throat can lead to infections due to instrumentation is known from intensive care units. Ventilated patients may risk getting pneumonia with bacteria from the throat. Several studies have shown that using mouthwash with a chlorhexidine solution can reduce the risk of ventilator associated pneumonia.||Hypothesis:||Mouthwash with 2 cl 0,2% chlorhexidine solution before a gastroscopy reduces the bacterial content in cultures taken from the stomach and the endoscope after a gastroscopy.||Simultaneous PPI treatment gives higher bacterial counts in the cultures.","Gastroscopy","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","January 2011","August 2011","Chlorhexidine","Other","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Denmark","Randomized","102",,

Treatment usually requires surgical debridement in association with appropriate antibiotic therapy. After surgery, an intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy is routinely indicated for 10 to 15 days, followed by a minimal one-month oral treatment. In this protocol, the latter includes clindamycin in combination with rifampin or levofloxacin. Clindamycin is considered a good option in staphylococcal infections, because of its action against biofilm formation and bacterial adherence, its high level of joint and bone penetration and its good tolerance. Rifampin, a potent cytochrome P-450 inducer, enhances the elimination of a large number of drugs. Therefore, an influence of rifampin on clindamycin pharmacokinetics must be considered.||Objectives:||The primary objective is to compare the influence of rifampin and levofloxacin respectively on the pharmacokinetics of clindamycin in a randomized series of peri-operative staphylococcal OAI. The investigators then seek to determine the optimal drug association with regard to infection control and drug tolerance.||Study design:||Monocentric, randomized, open label, comparative study||Study period:||From November 2010 to October 2011.||Materials and Methods:||Following surgical debridement and after 10 to 15 days of IV antibiotherapy, patients are randomly assigned either to the ""clindamycin/rifampin"" arm either to the ""clindamycin/levofloxacin"" arm, according to the antimicrobial susceptibility testing.

Hopefully, this information will allow timely intervention to prevent infection, i.e. by detecting early stages of infection or discerning common patterns of stable mutualistic-commensal bacterial strains, effective intervention protocols (antibiotics, probiotics or manipulation of the stomal and skin microbiota) may be developed to avoid patient morbidity and assure implant survival.","Transfemoral Amputation","No","Observational","October 1, 2015","September 30, 2018",,,,"All","80 Years","18 Years",,,"United States",,"10","0","0"

The human microbiota is the general term of the genetic information of microorganisms that coexist with human beings and cause various diseases under certain conditions. The results of human microbial genome analysis show that the microbial communities in different parts of the human body and different individuals have amazing diversity, some of which play an important role in human health, and some are closely related to diseases. Female lower genital tract infection is often associated with human papillomavirus (HPV) infection and bacterial vaginosis (BV), such as cervical and vaginal precancerous lesions, cancer, condyloma acuminatum and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD). Persistent infection of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) is closely related to the occurrence of invasive cervical cancer. New evidence suggests that vaginal microbiota composition is different in women with HR-HPV infection and high-grade cervical lesions. The increase of the severity of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia is related to the decrease of the relative abundance of vaginal Lactobacillus. In addition to vaginal microbes, the powerful intestinal flora is considered to be the ""invisible organ"" of the human body. There is a dynamic and balanced interaction network between intestinal microorganisms and human immune cells. Once the intestinal flora is out of balance, the changes in species, quantity, proportion, location and biological characteristics will cause a series of inflammatory reactions and immune system diseases, and even lead to cancer. Some studies have shown that there is a potential relationship between intestinal microorganisms and vaginal microorganisms.

Adequate surgical debridement decreases the bacterial load, removes dead tissues, and gives a chance for the host immune system and antibiotics to arrest infection. Adequate debridement may leave a large bony defect. An appropriate management of the dead space is essential to arrest the disease, and for maintenance of the bone's integrity. The current strategy includes the use of antibiotic-loaded bone cement that can be used to sterilize and temporarily maintain the dead space. The cement are usually removed after 2 to 4 weeks and replaced with a cancellous graft harvested from the hip of the patient.||CERAMENT™| G is a CE-marked resorbable ceramic bone graft substitute composed by calcium sulfate and calcium hydroxyapatite, intended to fill gaps and voids in the skeleton system and to promote bone healing.

7380,"Completed","Respiratory and gastrointestinal infections are common in children under the age of 4 years, especially after the start of schooling. These conditions are facilitated by a still incomplete functional maturation of the immune system and the anatomical structure and function of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract still developing. The frequency and duration of these conditions involves a high discomfort and significant costs, in relation to medical appointments, taking medication, the need for hospitalization, days of absence from school and work days lost by parents. Functional foods derived from the fermentation of cow's milk with probiotic strains have been proposed for the prevention of infectious diseases in children. Several products have been investigated, with sometimes conflicting results. Diversity in experimental designs, populations evaluated, and bacterial strains used in the preparation of fermented products are probably responsible for these discrepancies. Recently we started a study approved by the Ethics Committee for Biomedical Activities ""Carlo Romano"" of the University of Naples ""Federico II"" (protocol number 210/12) to evaluate the effectiveness of foods fermented with Lactobacillus paracasei CBA-L74 in the prevention of common winter infections in school children aged between 12 and 48 months. Studies of pre-clinical phase showed anti-inflammatory activity of milk fermented with the strain Lactobacillus paracasei L74-CBA in terms of stimulation of the production of the cytokine IL-10 and decreased synthesis of IL-12, also in response to stimulation with Salmonella typhimurium. The data were obtained in in vitro studies on dendritic cells and ex vivo intestinal biopsies as well as in tests on healthy mice and on a mouse model of experimental colitis. A preliminary analysis of the data was found that subjects treated with fermented milk showed fewer infectious episodes, as well as a lower incidence of respiratory tract infections or gastrointestinal, with a statistically significant difference between the study groups.

From 2017-2019, the investigators' institution has conducted approximately 270 primary and secondary breast augmentation procedures. Current plastic surgery literature does not provide recommendations for antibiotic prophylaxis following implant-based breast procedures. Despite controversy surrounding their utility during the postoperative course, postoperative antibiotics have become commonplace for many plastic surgeons. To date, strong scientific evidence supporting this practice is minimal and based largely on anecdotal evidence and limited studies, including poorly controlled retrospective and non-blinded prospective series. The goal of this study is to conduct a prospective randomized trial to assess whether extended antibiotic prophylaxis is necessary to prevent infection and long-term complications (e.g. capsular contracture) in patients undergoing augmentation mammoplasty with implants. The investigators' anticipate that extended antibiotic prophylaxis is not required. The rationale for discontinuing postoperative antibiotics is based on the following: (1) a single dose of preoperative intravenous antibiotics has been demonstrated to be sufficient prophylaxis for most breast surgeries and (2) there are patient safety concerns associated with prolonged antimicrobial use such as the development of resistant bacterial strains and clostridium-related infections. Concrete evidence that extended antibiotic prophylaxis is not required would encourage plastic surgeons to practice better antibiotic stewardship and help stymie the rise of drug-resistant organisms.","Surgical Site Infection|Capsular Contracture Associated With Breast Implant|Antibiotic Resistant Infection|Antibiotic Side Effect","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","April 1, 2021","July 30, 2024","Cefazolin|Cephalexin|Placebo","Drug|Drug|Other","Phase 4","Female",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment",,"Randomized","164",,

Because liposome particles are small enough to penetrate and diffuse through sputum into the bacterial biofilm, they deposit drug close to the bacterial colonies (Meers, et al., 2008) (Clancy, et al., 2013), thus improving the bioavailability of amikacin at the infection site. The clinically achievable doses of amikacin in the LAI formulation can effectively increase the half-life of the drug in the lungs, and decrease the potential for systemic toxicity. LAI offers several advantages over current therapies in treating patients with CF with chronic infection caused by P. aeruginosa.","Cystic Fibrosis","No","Interventional","January 8, 2009","November 2, 2010","Arikayce™","Drug","Phase 2","All",,"6 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","Belgium|Hungary|Hungary|North Macedonia|Poland|Poland|Serbia|Slovakia|Slovakia|Ukraine|Ukraine","N/A","49","0","15"

Long term exposure to antibiotics increases bacterial resistance, a major problem of public health. Several studies show that serious infectious can be treated safely by a shorter treatment and with oral antibiotics. There is no randomized controlled trial to establish the duration of antibiotics in native joint infections. Moreover, no consensus prevails on the administration route and duration of antimicrobial therapy. Although most clinicians acknowledge the interest of oral antibiotics and shorter treatment duration, randomized controlled trials are necessary to evaluate this practice. The SHASAR project aims to evaluate whether a shorter antibiotic treatment (3 week treatment) is safe and not inferior to the conventional 6 week treatment in native joint infections.

During sepsis, experimental and clinical data suggest the occurrence of mitochondrial dysfunctions, particularly in circulating muscle and monocytes, which may contribute to organ failure and death.||Lower respiratory infection is the leading cause of death from infectious causes. Mechanical ventilation (MV) is required in 20% of cases of bacterial pneumopathy with Streptococcus pneumoniae (S.p.) , with mortality reaching 50%. There are then frequently criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), combining bilateral lung involvement and marked hypoxemia.||Cyclic stretching of lung cells induced by MV causes sterile inflammation and tissue damage (i.e. ventilator-induced lung injury [VILI]), which can cause cellular dysfunction that alter the immune response, particularly during ARDS. This is why the application of a so-called protective MV is then required. However, this does not prevent about one-third of patients from showing signs of alveolar overdistension, as evidenced by an increase in motor pressure (MP) (MP≥ 15 cmH2O), associated with an increase in mortality.||The deleterious effects of MV could be explained by the occurrence of mitochondrial abnormalities. Indeed, the cyclic stretching of lung cells leads to dysfunction in the respiratory chain and the production of free oxygen radicals (FOS), altering membrane permeability. These phenomena could promote VILI, facilitate the translocation of bacteria from the lung to the systemic compartment and lead to alterations in immune response.||In our model of S.p. pneumopathy in rabbits, animals on MV develop more severe lung disorders (lack of pulmonary clearance of bacteria, bacterial translocation in the blood, excess mortality), compared to animals on spontaneous ventilation (SV). Intracellular pulmonary mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) concentrations, a reflection of the mitochondrial pool, are significantly decreased in ventilated rabbits compared to SV rabbits and in infected rabbits compared to uninfected rabbits. At the same time, the mitochondrial content of circulating cells decreased early (H8) in all infected rabbits, but was only restored in rabbits in SV, those who survived pneumonia (Blot et al, poster ECCMID 2015, submitted article). These data suggest an alteration in the mechanisms that restore mitochondrial homeostasis (mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy) during the dual infection/MV agression, which may explain the observed excess mortality. Other work by our team illustrates the importance of these phenomena by showing in a mouse model of polymicrobial infection that inhibition of mitophagia in macrophages promotes survival (Patoli et al, in preparation). Human data on this subject are non-existent.||The phenomena of mitochondrial dysfunction nevertheless deserve to be explored in humans during the combined MV/pneumopathy aggression in order to understand its possible impact on the effectiveness of the host's immune response. In a personalized medicine approach, these data would open up prospects for targeted therapies, capable of activating mitochondrial biogenesis and/or modulating mitophagia, to prevent organ dysfunction and mortality during severe CALs treated with antibiotic therapy.","Lung Diseases|Mechanical Ventilation|Bronchoalveolar Lavage","No","Observational","June 11, 2019","January 2023","bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL)|Venous blood","Biological|Biological",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"France",,"51",,

Veterans with spinal cord injury (SCI) frequently require chronic bladder catheterization. Most individuals with SCI have neurogenic bladders, and the resulting urinary stasis and bladder catheterization predispose them to recurrent UTI.1 The presence of a urinary catheter dramatically increases the risk of UTI, not only through contamination of the urinary tract during catheter changes, but also by the presence of a foreign body in the urethra and bladder. Implanted urinary catheters rapidly acquire a complex, three-dimensional biofilm composed of bacteria, their extracellular products, and components deposited from bodily fluids. The pathogenic organisms in a biofilm continually seed the bladder, leading to bacteriuria and/or UTI.2 Bacterial interference, or using benign bacteria to prevent infection with virulent pathogens,3, 4 may offer a solution to the significant problem of recurrent episodes of UTI in persons with indwelling catheters. Since biofilm formation on a wet implanted device such as a urinary catheter is nearly impossible to prevent,5, 6 we propose instead to manipulate the adherent microbial flora. We propose that inserting urinary catheters than have been pre-inoculated with a benign strain of Escherichia coli (83972) will be an efficient means to colonize the neurogenic bladder with this harmless organism.

The presence of a diverse population of bacteria in CF infections therefore predicts a better outcome for treatment than when a population consists of a small number of more virulent organisms.||Study Hypothesis 2||Pseudomonas aeruginosa hypermutators can mutate much more often than ordinary Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria. Hypermutators are likely to grow better when the bacteria are under stress, such as during antibiotic treatment or during an infection. They are, however, weaker organisms because of the multiple mutations they have undergone. Their presence does not relate to clinical outcome but may be associated with the emergence of antibiotic resistance.||Study Hypothesis 3||Some Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria communicate with each other by secreting and responding to chemicals known as quorum sensing (QS)molecules. As well as affecting the behaviour of bacteria, these QS molecules can cause inflammation in the lung of CF patients. Selective growth of QS-producing organisms can trigger lung exacerbations in CF. If antibiotics kill this population of bacteria and QS molecule levels drop in the lung, patients recover from infection quickly.

7442,"Recruiting","Introduction: The current evidence on the efficacy of Antibiotic Loaded Bone Cement (ALBC) in reducing the risk of periprosthetic joint infections (PJI) after primary joint reconstruction is insufficient. In several European countries, the use of ALBC is routine practice unlike in the US where ALBC use is not approved in low-risk patients. It has been claimed that the antibiotic in ALBC increase the risk of aseptic loosening, risk of systemic toxicity, allergic reaction, and bacterial resistance. Therefore we designed a double-blinded (patients and data analysts) pragmatic multicenter register-based randomized controlled non-inferiority trial to investigate the effects of ALBC compared to plain bone cement in primary total knee arthroplasty (TKA).||Methods and analysis: A minimum of 9,172 patients undergoing full-cemented primary TKA will be recruited and equally randomized into the ALBC group and the plain bone cement group. This trial will be conducted in Norwegian hospitals that routinely perform cemented primary TKA. . The primary outcome will be risk of revision surgery due to PJI at 1-year of follow-up. Secondary outcomes will be:||risk of revision due to any reason including aseptic loosening at 1-, 6-, 10-, and 20-years of follow-up;|patient related outcome measures (PROMs) like function, pain, satisfaction, and health-related quality of life at 1-, 6-, and 10-years of follow-up;|risk of changes in the microbial pattern and resistance profiles of organisms cultured in subsequent revisions at 1-, 6-, 10-, and 20-years of follow-up; and|cost-effectiveness of routine ALBC vs plain bone cement use in primary TKA. We will use 1:1 randomization with random permuted blocks and stratify by participating hospitals to randomize patients to receive ALBC or plain bone cement. Inclusion, randomization, and follow-up will be through the Norwegian Arthroplasty Register.||Ethics and dissemination: The trial has been approved by the Western Norway Regional Committees on Medical and Health Research Ethics (REK-Vest) (reference number: 2019/751/REK vest) dated: 21.06.2019.

Approximately 3 million individuals suffer craniofacial trauma in the United States on a yearly basis, and approximately 50% of all wounds presenting to emergency rooms involve the head and neck (1, 2). Treatment of these fractures often results in standard surgical interventions. While up to the early 1980's perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis in maxillofacial surgery was controversial, its efficacy is well accepted today (3). Previous research work showed that the administration of antibiotics one hour preoperatively and eight hours after the intervention reduces the incidence of infectious complications in facial fractures from 42.2% to 8.9% (4). However there is still no consensus about the duration of the postoperative administration. In literature postoperative prophylaxis in facial fractures varies from single-shot up to duration of 7 and even ten days postoperatively. The use of antibiotics can be associated with allergic or toxic reactions, adverse effects, drug interactions and increasing bacterial resistance (5). In addition some authors assume that a prolonged administration of antibiotics might increase the risk of infectious complications via superinfection. On the other hand a short term or single shot administration might not be enough to prevent the onset of a postoperative infection. Up to date there is no standard to support the duration of antibiotic administration after surgical repair of a facial fracture. In this proposal, Investigators are aiming to investigate if either the utility of antibiotics administered for 3 days or 5 days make a difference in the clinical outcomes after facial fractures.","Trauma Injury",,"Observational","July 29, 2016","July 8, 2022","Antibiotics","Drug",,"All",,"18 Years",,,"United States",,"1000",,

Aggressive surgical debridement to remove all necrotic tissue and define the extent of the disease is still the mainstay of correct treatment of NSTI.||Both negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) and the application of allograft skin to debrided areas, are documented options for wound bed preparation which are standard in the university hospital of Gent.||NPWT is a technique for wound bed preparation involving the controlled application of sub-atmospheric pressure to the local wound environment, using a sealed wound dressing connected to a vacuum pump. Mechanisms of action attributed to NPWT include an increase in blood flow, promotion of angiogenesis, reduction in wound surface area, positive modulation of the inhibitory contents of wound fluid, induction of cell proliferation, reduction of edema, and bacterial clearance.||Allograft skin or cadaveric skin possesses many of the ideal properties of biologic dressings, and plays a major role in the surgical management of extensive wounds when autologous tissue may not be immediately available.

7506,"Completed","Post-operative antibiotics for infection prophylaxis are routinely given to most surgical patients, and for orthopaedic surgery patients, the standard of care is treatment for 24 hours following any elective procedure (1). The most concerning risk for insufficient antibiotic coverage in the post-operative period is the development of a complicated infection requiring irrigation and debridement or revision surgery. Moreover, recovery from surgery is usually delayed in patients that have postoperative wound infections leading to increased resource utilization and increased economic cost for the health care system. It is clear that prophylactic antibiotic therapy is necessary in the immediate post-operative period, but the length required continues to be debated.||Orthopaedic patients undergoing elective spine surgeries often require the placement of a hemovac drain which applies gentle suction to remove excess fluid/blood and to promote healing. Wound drains, however, may also increase the risk of post-operative infection because they expose the ""clean"" interior aspect of the wound to the ""dirty"" exterior area around the wound. Given this additional focus of infection, it is unknown whether prolonged antibiotic therapy post-operatively is needed to decrease the rate of infection in this population (2,3). There is sparse literature evaluating the effectiveness of prolonged antibiotic therapy in decreasing complicated post-operative infection requiring irrigation and debridement in this population (1,4). To our knowledge, there are no recent studies comparing prophylactic antibiotics for 24 hours only post-operatively versus 24 hours after removal of the drain. In fact, a recent evidence-based review of the literature by the North American Spine Society highlighted the need for research in this area (5).||The proposed study will compare two patient populations who will receive various lengths of post-operative antibiotics. One will receive only 24 hours worth, and the other will receive antibiotics for 72 hours after surgery and the rate of complicated infection compared between the two.||The absence of a demonstrable difference suggests that antibiotic prophylaxis for only 24 hours immediately post-operatively is sufficient for all elective spine patients undergoing posterior spine procedures requiring the placement of a hemovac drain.","Postoperative Infection","No","Interventional","October 2011","August 2018","Antibiotic|Antibiotic","Drug|Drug","Phase 4","All",,"16 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Canada","Randomized","645",,

The figures currently report 37 million people infected with HIV worldwide, as well as 2 million new infections every year, the majority of which are men who have sex with men (MSM).||HIV research has accounted for more than 335,000 publications on PubMed since its first description in 1981. However, many questions remain unanswered, especially regarding the risk factors and protective factors, its transmission and acquisition, during sexual intercourse. By creating a background on PubMed with the keyword ""HIV"", we can see that at the end of the 80's, it was already established that male circumcision decreased the risk of transmission of HIV by 50 to 60%. Multiple hypotheses have been studied to justify this discovery, such as the reduction of micro-traumatisms, the modification of keratinization, the modification of penile anatomy induced by foreskin removal. In parallel, the rise of the study of the human microbiota, which refers to all microorganisms (bacteria, viruses, archaea, fungi and parasites) living in a specific environment, the human body, and this in a healthy or pathological situation. There is evidence that the microbiota may be involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases and may play a major role in the homeostasis of the human body. This implication has also interested researchers in the field of HIV : the protective role of circumcision in the acquisition and transmission of HIV has therefore begun to be studied in terms of the modification of the penile microbiome.||The first studies showed that circumcision had an impact on the abundance of bacteria present in the penis in humans, and modified the aerobic / anaerobic ratio in favor of the increase of aerobic bacteria. The first hypothesis was that circumcision played a protective role in the acquisition and transmission of HIV through a decrease in the diversity of the penile microbiota and in particular anaerobes.||This discovery was disrupted by the emergence of studies tending to question a microbiota predisposing to the risk of HIV acquisition in both men and women.||Indeed, it has been shown that certain bacteria (Prevotella, Dialister, ...) could favor the acquisition of the virus by the attraction in their wake of inflammation cells such as CD4 and Langerhans cells which would facilitate by their presence. , the penetration of the virus. This hypothesis has been proven in studies of bacterial vaginosis, which is known to be a risk factor for HIV acquisition and transmission. In 2012, results showed that the loss of Lactobacillus, in favor of anaerobic increases such as Gardnerella, Atopobium, and Prevotella, increased this risk against the HIV virus. Similarly, 7 bacteria have recently been incriminated in this phenomenon of susceptibility to HIV acquisition (Parvimonas, Gemella asaccharolytica, Mycoplasma hominis, Leptotrichia / Sneathia, Eggerthellaspecies and Megasphaeraspecies).Being committed to the exploration of the human microbiota in particular by culture, we propose to extend the knowledge of balano-preputial furrow 's microbiota in patients infected by HIV or not and supported in department Infectious Diseases.

Among postoperative complications, respiratory failures (nosocomial pneumonia, ARDS) are currently the most frequent and serious, as well as being the primary cause of hospital death, after major pulmonary resections. Vast majority of these complications are notoriously infectious and should be considered as hospital-acquired infections. These complications result in a dramatic increased of substantial hospital costs in term of length of hospital stay, antibiotics and morbidity. Current management of these complications stands on antibiotics, oxygen supply and physiotherapy. In severe case, a ventilatory support (invasive or non invasive) is justify in near 25 % of cases.||Recent data have suggested that proximal airways colonizations could be an essential first step in the pathogenesis of theses respiratory failures. Previous works have long demonstrated that bacterial colonization was frequent between 21 to 40 % in lung cancer patients. These colonizations could act as a major predisposing factor to these postoperative respiratory failures. Because distal airways and lung parenchyma are free from bacteria at the moment of the surgery, respiratory complications should be the result from contamination by potential microorganisms belonging the upper aero-digestive tract. Consequently, decontamination of the oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal cavities before and during the first days after surgery could have a beneficial advantage in the prevention of these complications. This decontamination has been demonstrated to be effective in critically-ill patients in intensive care unit, in cardiac surgery and in esophageal surgery. Decontamination of oropharynx and nasopharynx with Chlorhexidine Gluconate has significantly reduced the rate of postoperative global hospital-acquired infections and respiratory infectious as well.

Epidemiological evidence points to the existence of intrinsic protection factors which make young persons and women more resistant to the infection, whereas older patients with multiple illnesses, above all with heart disease, are at greatest risk. This trial proposes treatment initiated in the early stages of the disease, when clinical worsening is most likely, with intravenous Oxytocin (OT), an endogenous hormone currently safely used in clinical practice. The selection of this molecule is based on numerous experimental and clinical observations, which show its activity in modulating resistance to pathogens, in mitigating overall cardiovascular risk, and in acting on the production of Nitric Oxide (ON) in the lungs, which is emerging as a key therapeutic factor for the improvement of respiratory function in patients with SARS-COVID 19. Finally, OT is physiologically produced by the human body, especially in the female sex and in the age ranges that coincide with most resistant patients. In routine clinical practice, OT exhibits an excellent therapeutic index, in absence of significant adverse effects.||Primary aim To assess the effects of Oxytocin in addition to standard therapy, with respect to Standard of Care (SoC), in reducing the number of patients who enter a critical stage Secondary aim||To describe:||Mortality 28 days after randomization|Time to mechanical ventilation during the study|Duration of dependency on oxygen supply|Length of stay|Temporal trend of clinical improvement (7-category ordinal scale)|Safety analysis","Covid-19|Corona Virus Infection|SARS-CoV 2","No","Interventional","September 1, 2020","December 31, 2020","Oxytocin|Standard of Care","Drug|Drug","Phase 2","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","France|Italy|Italy","Randomized","0",,

In return, the immune system determines the composition of the microbiota. Altered microbial composition (dysbiosis) has been correlated with a number of diseases in humans. The real role of the microbiota in transplant recipients is still unknown even though we suspect that it may be affected directly or indirectly by immunosuppressive drugs and antimicrobial prophylaxis taken by transplant patients, as well as by inflammatory process secondary to ischemia/reperfusion injury.||A number of studies have investigated the impact of liver transplantation on the intestinal microbiota. In a recent analysis of stool flora (Microb Ecol 2013; 65: 781-791) in 12 liver transplant recipients, changes in the microbiota were correlated to post-transplant infections. The authors suggested that the shift to pathogenic strains of bacteria due to the use of prophylactic antibiotics may be contributing to post-transplant complications. In a larger study, Wu et al (Hepatobiliary Pancreat Dis Int 2012; 11: 40-50) demonstrated marked changes in the gut microbiota post-transplantation with an increase in Enterobacteriaceae and Enterococcus, and reduction in Eubacteria, Bifidobacterium and Lactobacillus species. These changes, however, resolved over time such that by 6 months, at times when bacterial prophylaxis ends and immunosuppression is reduced.||A better characterization of the impact of post-transplant therapy on the human microbiota has the potential to improve our understanding of the infection process and translate into development of new therapeutic strategies.||The main goal of this study is to characterize intestinal microbiota and confirm the same bacterial DNA in peripheral blood and portal lymph nodes in patients affected with end-stage chronic liver disease, and to analyze its evolution from the moment of inclusion in waiting list throughout the first year after liver transplantation.

However, innate immune defences are usually able to control and eliminate bacterial growth before postoperative endophthalmitis occurs.

Splenectomy may also be performed due to splenic traumas or in association of some surgical procedures, when combined splenectomy will make the operations easier. The most well known procedure is distal pancreatectomy combined with splenectomy.||In this research, there are two main goals. Firstly, establish the data about the incidence of overwhelming postsplenectomy infection (OPSI) in our country. Currently, the western data of the incidence, morbidity rate and mortality rate of OPSI is well established and vaccination along with prophylactic antibiotics is strongly recommended. Since the incidence of OPSI in our country isn't clear, most (>95%) splenectomized patients in our hospital (National Taiwan University Hospital) did not have vaccination or prophylactic antibiotics. We'll try to determine the incidence of OPSI by reviewing of our hospital charts and by structured interviews with patients.||The spleen is a phagocytic filter. So asplenic patients have higher risks of getting infection and some spleen-preserving procedures are proposed. In our initial experiences, distal pancreatectomy with splenic artery and vein divided could be safely performed and greatly increased the possibility of preservation of spleen. However, when the spleen was preserved with dividing the splenic artery and vein, the blood supply to the spleen will be shifted from splenic artery to short gastric artery. Although a substantial immunologic advantage exists if splenic tissue remains, this may not offer sufficient protection from encapsulated bacteria if splenic arterial blood flow is reduced because experimental animal studies have demonstrated that an intact splenic arterial system is necessary for optimal control of infection. Thus, although the spleen is preserved in above mentioned procedure, the function of the preserved spleen is questionable and has never been studied of. Our second object is to determine the splenic function after after spleen-preserving distal pancreatectomy with excision of splenic artery and vein by comparison of abdominal computed tomography and immunological function of patients before and after operation. Besides, we'll designed an animal experiment to examine the rate of pneumococcal clearance by the spleen and to determine the relationship between splenic blood flow and splenic tissue mass in bacterial clearance from the blood when the splenic vessels were divided.","Overwhelming Post-Splenectomy Infection","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","January 2006","December 2012",,,,"All",,,,,"Taiwan",,"40",,

Almost 50% of women have at least one urinary tract infection in their lifetime; following this first infection, there is a 25-35% chance that she will have another infection in the subsequent 3-6 months. With each documented infection, a patient receives anywhere from a three to seven day course of antibiotics for treatment. Repeated courses of antibiotics often lead to the development of multi-drug resistant infections that are difficult to treat with our arsenal of oral medications. It is theorized that most, if not all, urinary tract infections are caused by bacteria from the gastrointestinal tract. If there is a generalized gut dysbiosis due to repeated courses of oral antibiotics, it will likely be difficult to ever adequately treat repeat urinary tract infections. This same theory led to the development and utilization of fecal microbiota transplantation in the treatment of refractory Clostridium difficile diarrhea. There are now several studies that have reported on the efficacy of fecal transplantation in the treatment of C.difficile infections as well as the correction of gut dysbiosis.

7609,"Completed","Systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) is characterized by changes in body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, or peripheral blood white cell count, and is often a heralding manifestation of blood infection (ie., sepsis or bloodstream infection). SIRS however can occur as a result of a stroke without sepsis. When SIRS occurs after stroke, patients are subjected to blood cultures and tests to exclude sepsis, and are often empirically treated with antibiotics potentially leading to a serious gastrointestinal infection called C. difficile enterocolitis, and bacterial antibiotic resistance. Development of a blood test that could provide sufficient sensitivity to exclude blood infection in stroke would therefore prevent numerous tests, cultures, antibiotics, and costs. In recent years, there has been increasing evidence that procalcitonin (PCT) may serve as diagnostic marker to distinguish between infectious and non-infectious SIRS. The investigators hypothesize that PCT can differentiate SIRS after stroke into patients with infection and those without infection. Such screening tests would provide crucial information to clinicians that could improve patient care by reducing the number of tests and antibiotics used, as well as antibiotic-related infections, bacterial resistance and hospital costs.||Hypothesis: The investigators hypothesize that PCT can be used to define normal (SIRS without infection) and abnormal values SIRS with infection (i.e., blood, lung, urinary, spinal fluid) in a population of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH).||Specific Aim 1.)

The vast majority are orphan disorders and are associated with extremely poor quality of life related to social ostracism from altered appearance, associated itchiness and discomfort, and functional limitations from the skin disease. Among the more common ""orphan"" forms of ichthyosis are autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI; includes lamellar ichthyosis/LI and congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma/CIE), Netherton syndrome (NS) and epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI). However, there are dozens of other syndromic and non-syndromic ichthyotic disorders as well. Therapy is time-consuming for patients or parents and is supportive, focusing on clearance of the scaling. There are no therapies based on our growing understanding of what causes the disease. We have recently found marked elevations in Th17/IL-23 pathway cytokines and chemokines in the skin of individuals with ichthyosis, most similar to the inflammatory pattern of psoriasis. While the significance of the high expression of Th17/IL-23 pathway genes across all forms of ichthyosis studied to date is unknown, the high expression of genes of the Th17/IL-23 pathway in psoriasis is thought to be causative for the disease manifestations.

Over the course of evolution, various microbes, especially bacteriae, have come to colonise the ocular surface as commensals. The commensals have a role to maintain the homeostasis of the ocular surface. 1 The innate immunity of the ocular surface is very active, and consists of active mechanisms to suppress inflammation 2. For example, there exist macrophages, dendritic cells, suppressor cells, regulatory cells, B cells, IgA, lysozyme, anti-microbial peptides and barriers against external agents. The normal commensals of the ocular surface maintain a basal level of activation of innate defence by stimulating the pattern recognition receptors on ocular surface epithelial cells. This normal composition of microbes is important since inflammation and infection will result if there is introduction of a pathogenic strain that overcomes the flora, or if a dominant strain secretes excessively immunogenic products, such as the exotoxin A of Staphylococcus which triggers marginal keratitis, a form of type IV hypersensitivity. The flora load of microbiome could also influence tear function as a higher flora load was found to be associated with increased mucin degradation 3 and reduced globet cell densitiy 4. Previous studies [I'm not sure which studies these are] at SERI/SNEC also point to the importance of microbes. For example, in dry eye patients, there is increased lysophospholipids in the tear, and this may contribute to inflammatory mediators such as arachidonic acid and other metabolites. The lysophospholipids are formed by phospholipase A2 reactions, and the latter may be microbial in origin.

They can occur in different parts of the abdomen, can be different sizes, and may or may not be caused by a perforated bowel. Management includes, where possible, surgical drainage of an abscess or treatment of the damaged bowel. In addition, all patients are given antibiotic therapy.

The most common hospital-acquired infection is Urinary Tract Infection (UTI), accounting for almost 40% of all nosocomial infections. Most hospital-acquired UTIs are associated with catheterization. In fact, urinary catheter-related bacteriuria is the most common health care associated infection worldwide. Catheter-associated UTI (CAUTI) develops following adhesion of planktonic bacteria to the surface of the catheter and colonization, creating a persistent environment called a biofilm. The nature of biofilm structure together with the physiological attributes of biofilm organisms confers an inherent resistance to various antimicrobial agents such as antibiotics, disinfectants or germicides, augmenting the potential of these pathogens to cause infections in catheterized patients.||Nitric oxide (NO) is a naturally-produced gas molecule with broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. NO is used in the clinics to treat pulmonary hypertension in neonates and adults. Studies have shown that low-dose NO is associated with prevention of biofilm formation, biofilm dispersal and elimination of bacteria. It is suggested that NO prevents bacteria attachment to catheter surfaces and inhibits biofilm formation in a mechanism involving reduction and modification of proteins that mediate cell-substrate and cell-cell interactions.||The investigators team, using a proprietary technology impregnate urinary catheters with NO (i.e. NO-impregnated catheters). These catheters release low concentration of NO following exposure to urine over a 14-day period.

7641,"Recruiting","Infusion and parenteral nutrition play an important role in the management of neonatal intensive care patients. Administration of drugs and parenteral nutrition solutions to the patient is performed via different systems including a catheter and a perfusion system. In critically ill, high risk neonates, use of these systems is associated with complications such as infections, interactions between drugs simultaneously infused on the same route (precipitates, catheter obstruction), less effective treatment due to modified amount of drug administered compared to expected or to compatibility issues between drugs. Sepsis and reduction of treatment efficacy can have an impact on survival or subsequent neurodevelopment. Late onset sepsis is one of the most frequent complications in very premature infants born before 33 weeks gestational age and most of those infections occur in infants requiring a perfusion system and an intravenous catheter.||In this context, a new multiperfusion device was developed (Multiline Néo®, Doran, France) to remove access to the infusion system from the incubator where high temperature and humidity favour bacterial growth. But also to allow the administration of several drug solutions simultaneously avoiding contact between drugs.||Our hypothesis is that the new perfusion system helps to reduce the risk of infections, without increase in costs.","Preterm Birth","No","Observational","November 1, 2018","December 31, 2022","Multiline Neo®","Device",,"All",,,,,"France",,"640",,

7643,"Completed","Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has remained a major cause of morbidity and mortality following allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation (SCT). The most reliable virological predictive marker for disease development is the presence of HCMV viremia. It has been further recognized that viral load, and viral load kinetics are important determinants of pathogenesis. Prior to the preventive use of antiviral agents, CMV disease occurred in 15-45% of at-risk patients and carried a high mortality rate. In the last decade, major advances in the prevention of CMV disease have occurred with the application of pp65 antigenemia and qualitative/quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for the rapid and sensitive diagnosis of HCMV infection, combined with preemptive antiviral treatment targeted to patients with viremia. The prevalence of early CMV disease has declined to 3% to 6% with intense antiviral drug use. All antiviral drugs currently used for the treatment of systemic HCMV infection, including ganciclovir, foscarnet, and cidofovir, target the HCMV DNA polymerase. Ganciclovir is the most widely used drug for preemptive treatment. However, ganciclovir treatment is often complicated by bone marrow toxicity with the occasional development of potentially life-threatening thrombocytopenia, granulocytopenia, and graft failure, associated with secondary bacterial and fungal infection. Another limitation of preemptive ganciclovir therapy is the requirement for intravenous administration. The currently available oral valganciclovir is not yet approved for preemptive therapy in SCT recipients, and is associated with high treatment cost. Additionally, prolonged or repeated ganciclovir treatment may lead to the development of drug resistance. The use of foscarnet and cidofovir is limited by considerable nephrotoxicity, low oral bioavailability, and high cost. Thus, there is an increasing need for new effective non-toxic, low-cost anti-HCMV drugs with high oral bioavailability.||Recently, the anti-malaria drug artesunate, which is widely used in the treatment of severe malaria, has been shown to be a highly effective inhibitor of HCMV in vitro. Artesunate exhibited similar antiviral activity (same micromolar range) to that of ganciclovir, while demonstrating no cytotoxicity. Importantly, its antiviral activity has been further demonstrated in vivo in a rat CMV model. No significant side effects were demonstrated in a number of pre-clinical and clinical studies, and artemisinin and its derivatives have been shown to be well-tolerated and safe in adults and children. Several million people have taken artemisinins to date, with no significant adverse or treatment-limiting effects being reported. Although neurotoxicity has been reported with supraphysiological doses in animals, it has not been documented in humans. Meta-analyses of malaria patients treated with artemisinins demonstrated that this drug class is safe. In rare cases, however, slight changes to haematology values have been seen, including a reduction in the number of reticulocytes as well as a slight increase in transaminase levels. These signs, however, do not generally give rise to any noticeable clinical manifestations. In rare cases, a slight but transient reduction in sinus heart rate has been observed. Abdominal cramps and mild diarrhoea have been reported at elevated doses.||Thus, one might expect a similarly high degree of safety for the potential use of artesunate as an antiviral drug for HCMV infection. Thus, oral therapy with artesunate could be a beneficial option to the current therapies for the preemptive treatment of HCMV disease in SCT recipients.","Cytomegalovirus Infections","No","Interventional","July 2006","March 2010","Artesunate","Drug","Phase 3","All","75 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","Israel","Non-Randomized","20",,

The severity of influenza is related to, among other things, its respiratory or neurological complications, observed especially in children. Early determination of the severity of influenza is a critical step to avoid in appropriate treatment and care for patients and to improve their survival. Viral, human but also environmental factors have been described as having an important role in determining this severity. Several studies suggest that the nasopharyngeal microbiome may be involved in the incidence and severity of respiratory viral infections. During influenza infection, the respiratory microbiota is significantly altered. In animal models, particularly murine models, the microbiota regulates the immune response to influenza virus infection. In a retrospective preliminary study, the investigators showed that the composition of the nasopharyngeal bacterial microbiota is different between children who develop a severe or moderate influenza. This difference was observed on respiratory specimens at admission to pediatric emergencies within two days of onset of symptoms.||Hypotheses :||The respiratory microbiome is a determining factor in the clinical course of influenza infection (benign vs. severe with respiratory or neurological complication)|The respiratory microbiome can be used as a prognostic biomarker of the clinical course of influenza Originality: There are currently no clinical and / or virological markers to predict the clinical course of influenza infection.

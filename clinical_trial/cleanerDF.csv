The reasons for this variability in bacterial infections between otherwise healthy subjects, between types of lung disease, and within the same type of lung disease are poorly understood.||Variability in susceptibility to bacterial infections is partially explained by differences in exposure to infectious agents, genetic susceptibility and innate (or early) immune responses. It is of interest that the incidence and severity of bacterial infections is greatest during the winter months. Other than viral infections, there are few variables that change with season. Vitamin D is one known immune modulator with a seasonal periodicity.

If left untreated, high-risk neuroblastoma is fatal. Children with high-risk neuroblastoma often respond to current available treatments, but there is a high risk that the cancer will return.||This study will test the safety of giving standard induction treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma without one of the drugs commonly used to prevent side effects. Current treatment for high-risk neuroblastoma includes anti-cancer drugs (chemotherapy), surgery, radiation therapy and high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell rescue. Treatment takes about one year to complete and occurs in 3 phases: induction, consolidation, and maintenance. This study is limited to the induction phase of treatment.||Induction therapy includes six chemotherapy drugs given in different combinations every 3 weeks for a total of 6 courses. For the past decade, induction chemotherapy has been followed by a drug called granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF, filgrastim, peg-filgrastim, Neupogen, or Neulasta) to prevent side effects from the chemotherapy. G-CSF is routinely given to patients with high risk neuroblastoma after chemotherapy to stimulate white blood cell production and shorten the time period when the absolute neutrophil count (ANC), a type of white blood cell, is low after chemotherapy. G-CSF is known to shorten the period of low ANC by approximately 3 days. When the ANC is lowest, a patient is most at risk of getting a bacterial infection.||Recent lab experiments in mice have shown that neuroblastoma tumor cells may respond to G-CSF by growing faster and metastasizing (spreading to other parts of the body). There have been no clinical trials comparing the survival of children with high risk neuroblastoma with or without G-CSF. This clinical trial is the first step towards giving induction chemotherapy with less G-CSF.||The goal of this study is to determine if it is safe to give induction chemotherapy to children with neuroblastoma without giving G-CSF routinely.",Neuroblastoma,No,979.0,Drug,Not Applicable,All,Treatment,Single Group Assignment,United States,SingleArmNA,13.0,8,adults-infants,11.0

When the body s immune system reacts against brain cells following a streptococcal infection, the condition is known as PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorders associated with streptococcal infections). The immune system response can be inactivated by treatment with a drug known as intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG). Because there is insufficient research on IVIG s effects on the immune system of children with PANDAS, including whether IVIG is helpful in treating obsessive-compulsive symptoms related to PANDAS, researchers are interested in examining whether IVIG is an appropriate treatment for PANDAS and its associated symptoms.||Objectives:||- To test the safety and effectiveness of intravenous immunoglobulin for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder in children with PANDAS (pediatric autoimmune neuropsychiatric disorder associated with streptococcal infection).||Eligibility:||- Children between 4 and 12 years of age who have obsessive-compulsive disorder (with or without a tic disorder) with sudden onset of symptoms following Group A streptococcal bacterial infections.||Design:||Participants will be screened by telephone to obtain medical history and other information, followed by in-person screening at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center.|Participants will be admitted to the hospital to receive 2 days of infusions of either IVIG or a placebo.

The encoded protein, CFTR, is an epithelial chloride ion channel responsible for aiding in the regulation of salt and water absorption and secretion in various tissues. Although the disease affects multiple organs, the leading cause of mortality is the progressive loss of lung function. Obstruction of airways with thick mucus, chronic bacterial infection of the airways, and inflammatory response are all thought to play a role in causing lung damage. Through its function as a chloride channel, CFTR is believed to be integral in epithelial ion and water transport and hence, maintaining the normal hydration of lung secretions.||VX-770 (ivacaftor) is a potent and selective potentiator of wild-type, G551D, F508del, and R117H forms of human CFTR.

Completed,"Babies having heart surgery often have problems after surgery with their blood pressure and getting enough blood to their bodies. To treat this they require medicines to keep their blood pressure high enough to get blood to their bodies. The side effects of these medicines include fast heart rates and increasing the amount of work the heart has to do. Corticosteroids are made by the body and help to use the energy in the food people eat, control the chemicals in their blood and maintain their blood pressure. Corticosteroids made by the body may be decreased in patients that have major surgery. Corticosteroids help to increase blood pressure and can decrease the amount of blood pressure medicines a patient requires. Corticosteroids have been shown to increase blood pressure in patients with bacterial infections and in very small, premature babies but have only been studied in a few babies who have had heart surgery. The way corticosteroids work is unknown but may involve decreasing the body's response to being on a heart-lung machine or give steroids not being made by the patient.||Corticosteroids have been shown to be helpful in treating many diseases. The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of corticosteroids in babies who have had heart surgery and need blood pressure medicines in the intensive care unit after surgery.

These methods include suppressive antibiotics, estrogen cream, methenamine hippurate, d-mannose, cranberry, probiotics, and vitamin C. Of these, the majority of the literature is in favor of use of suppressive antibiotics for preventing UTIs. However, this data is now about 10 years old. Increasing use of antibiotics over the years has lead to increased resistance of bacteria. In addition, long-term antibiotic use has several adverse effects, some life-threatening.

Completed,"This study is designed to evaluate a potential mechanism by which a hyperactive immune response may contribute to death from SARS-CoV-2; by an excessive neutrophil-mediated deposition of cell-free DNA in neutrophil extracellular traps (NET). Excessive amounts of NETs can increase rigidity of mucus, clog airways, and be agents for the development of acute respiratory distress (Narasaraju et al., Am J Pathol. 2011). Many aspects of this pathway have been observed in severe SARS-CoV-2 (Zhang et al., Respiratory research. 2020). Dornase alfa (DNAse I; Pulmozyme (Genentech) is a nebulized drug that works by degrading cell-free DNA and thus promoting airway clearance and recovery. The investigators hypothesize that by thinning mucus and degrading these NETs further lung damage may be prevented and a reduction in time to recovery may occur. The two aims of the study are to see if inhaled/nebulized dornase alfa will improve clinical outcome measures in SARS-CoV-2 related acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and to see if dornase alfa reduces the amount of bronchoalveolar lavage and blood markers of NET activity.||The study will recruit patients who are on mechanical ventilation for respiratory failure related to SARS-CoV-2 positive infection and have ARDS based upon Berlin criteria.||The investigators aim to recruit 10-20 patients for this study.",SARS-CoV 2|ARDS,No,195.0,Drug,Phase 3,All,Treatment,Parallel Assignment,United States,Non-Randomized,30.0,1,elderly-adults,29.0

Completed,"The most common etiology of infection-related death or neurodevelopmental impairment in neonates with birthweight <750 g is invasive candidiasis. Over 70% of the premature neonates who develop invasive candidiasis will die or suffer severe, permanent neurologic impairment. Fluconazole has been commonly used off-label in the neonatal intensive care unit, but definitive recommendations for its use in the nursery have been hampered by the limited number of well-designed trials. In neonates weighing <750 g, appropriate dosing is not known, definitive safety and long-term follow up trials have not been completed, and there have not been well-powered trials conducted to establish the efficacy of the product using mortality as part of the primary endpoint. Three recent proof-of-concept studies suggest that fluconazole will be safe and effective, and a recently completed pharmacokinetic study is providing data to give preliminary dosing guidance. The next logical step in drug development is proposed by this research: to conduct a pivotal trial to determine the safety and efficacy of fluconazole in premature neonates with 2-year neurodevelopmental follow-up assessment.||362 neonates, with a birthweight <750g, were randomized at 33 US centers, to twice weekly fluconazole (6 mg/kg) or placebo for the first 6 weeks of life.

"Active, not recruiting","This study is a collaboration between New York Presbyterian (NYP)-Columbia and NYP-Cornell that seeks to evaluate the use of topical vancomycin and its reduction on surgical site infection (SSI) in neurosurgical procedures. Adult patients undergoing neurosurgery at either institution will be eligible for participation in this randomized control trial. Patients randomized to the treatment group will receive 2g of vancomycin applied as a powder or paste to the wound site and/or bone flap. Subjects in the control group will receive the current standard of care without topical vancomycin. All subjects will undergo swabbing of the anterior nares and the surgical site prior to surgery, once 10-14 days following the operation and 90 days following the operation. The primary outcome measure will be surgical site infection, assessed daily throughout the hospital stay, at the first follow-up visit, and by telephone at 14-30 days and 90 days (+/- 7 days). Secondary outcomes will include length of hospital stay, length of intensive care stay, rate of reoperation and patient mortality. In addition, systemic vancomycin levels will be assessed at 6 hours and 20 hours postoperatively in each patient. Patients who have an external ventricular drain in place will have vancomycin levels assessed daily. In patients who have cranial drains placed, vancomycin concentrations will be analyzed from daily in wound drainage. Skin and nasal flora will be analyzed to assess the impact of topical vancomycin on the patient microbiome. Although there has been a decrease in the incidence of infections following craniotomy secondary to prophylactic intravenous antibiotics, proper sterile techniques, and other interventions, SSIs continue to significantly impact morbidity, mortality, and cost burden. Although never studied in neurosurgical procedures other than instrumented spine, the application of topical vancomycin to the surgical site prior to wound closure has demonstrated a reduction in SSIs in spine, cardiac and ophthalmologic procedures. The benefits of using prophylactic vancomycin topically, as opposed to intravenously, include reduced systemic levels of the drug, and therefore, a decreased probability of adverse events related to the drug, such as inducing resistance among the native flora.

Terminated,"Vancomycin is an essential antimicrobial which is frequently used in the ICU for suspected methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection. Therefore, it is vital to optimize the dosing of vancomycin for this critically ill population. The most efficacious method of administering vancomycin is debated in the literature. Since vancomycin is associated with slow bactericidal activity, it is important to closely monitor serum concentrations so as to achieve early target serum concentration, particularly when treating aggressive S. aureus infections. One study has shown that vancomycin infused continuously may enable faster and more consistent achievement of a therapeutic serum concentration when compared to intermittent infusion. A faster achievement in the goal serum vancomycin concentration would be a protective factor for intensive care unit mortality in patients with MRSA infection.||Currently in the surgical ICU (SICU) of our institute, vancomycin is administered based on a vancomycin dosing nomogram. Less than fifty percent of the ICU patients following this nomogram achieved target vancomycin concentration of 15 after 24 hours. To better achieve target vancomycin concentration in 24 hours, we developed a new vancomycin dosing nomogram with a continuous infusion. The aim is to determine which of the two dosing nomogram is more efficient and safer for SICU patients.",MRSA - Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection,No,1004.0,Drug,Phase 4,All,Treatment,Parallel Assignment,United States,Randomized,44.0,2,elderly-adults,0.0

Completed,"Daptomycin is a new antimicrobial agent which has activity against resistant Gram positive cocci including MRSA. The phase 3 clinical trials for skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI) with Staphylococci and Streptococci have already demonstrated that daptomycin was noninferior to the comparator agent (vancomycin or beta-lactams) (10). Although this clinical trial did not include any patients with clostridial infection, there is in vitro data to support the activity of daptomycin against a variety of clostridial species(11) ( Clostridium perfringens) Therefore, for this trial we will include patients with clostridial infections with this species. Additionally, the patients in the SSTI study were not as ill as the proposed study population. Therefore for treatment of such severe infections, we would like to use a higher dose of daptomycin (6mg/kg/dose). The reasons for using a higher dose of daptomycin in this subgroup are as follows:||Patients who are severely ill have an increased volume of distribution; and therefore have a lower serum concentration of daptomycin. These patients might require a higher dose of daptomycin to achieve the desired serum concentration.|One of the organisms involved in necrotizing fasciitis is enterococcus (both-fecalis and faecium). E.faecium has higher MICs to daptomycin and would require a higher dose of the drug to achieve adequate free (unbound) serum concentration of the drug.|Both necrotizing fasciitis and endocarditis are serious deep seated infections. The clinical trials for endocarditis are using 6mg/kg/dose of daptomycin.||Therefore for optimal treatment of necrotizing fasciitis, it is justifiable that we should use the higher dose of daptomycin.||Objective:||To evaluate the clinical and microbiological efficacy and safety of higher dose daptomycin therapy in the treatment of patients with severe necrotizing skin and soft tissue infections.||Type of Study:||Open label, single center study.","Fasciitis, Necrotizing|Severe Necrotizing Skin and Soft Tissue Infections|Fournier's Gangrene",No,1065.0,Drug,Not Applicable,All,Treatment,Single Group Assignment,United States,SingleArmNA,25.0,1,elderly-adults,2.0

Preliminary data from our rabbit pivotal efficacy study showed significant survival benefit for raxibacumab over placebo. Exposure to anthrax and resulting clinical disease can occur more than once, especially in individuals who do not develop protective immunity. Hence, if clinically indicated for the treatment of anthrax, there may be a requirement for the repeat administration of raxibacumab.

A subset of these children (20-48%), will develop recurrent UTI (RUTI), which may have long-term effects in the form of hypertension or renal damage.||In an effort to prevent RUTIs physicians prescribe sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim (Septra) or nitrofurantoin as low dose antibiotic prophylaxis. However, recent evidence suggests that during prophylactic therapy the body is exposed to antibiotic levels capable of increasing antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence. This has been shown to be true in the uropathogens E. coli and Staphylococcus saprophyticus, yet it is not known if Enterococcus sp. demonstrate similar mechanisms. Additionally, antibiotics have been shown to disrupt the natural balance of the human microbiome, potentially leading to major long term problems.||As a uropathogen, enterococci consistently rank in the top 3 causes of RUTI, especially in children under 3 years of age. Additionally, Enterococcus is notorious for developing antibiotic resistance and studies have shown that children with enterococcal UTIs exhibit a higher rate of recurrence than those with non-enterococcal UTIs.||The investigators hypothesize the current practice of antibiotic prophylaxis in children with RUTI is detrimental and can change the bacterial and sensitivity profiles of these patients.",Urinary Tract Infection|Recurrent Urinary Tract Infection,Accept,1277.0,Drug,Phase 4,All,Basic Science,Parallel Assignment,Canada,Non-Randomized,59.0,1,childTeen-infants,0.0

Terminated,"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) Neisseria gonorrhoeae (NG) as one of the nation's top three urgent AMR threats. Since the advent of antibiotics in the 1930s, NG has developed resistance to every first-line antibiotic. Parenteral third-generation cephalosporins are now the only class of drug with consistent efficacy against NG. New therapies are urgently needed. Although some novel antimicrobials are under development, reevaluating older drugs is another option for quickly identifying additional treatments for gonorrhea. We propose a demonstration study to test a single dose of gentamicin for the treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea. We chose to focus on pharyngeal gonorrhea because these infections are common, play an important role in fostering gonococcal resistance, and are harder to eradicate than genital infections. Although gentamicin is 91% efficacious for genital NG, its efficacy at the pharynx may be less since streptomycin, another aminoglycoside previously used to treat gonorrhea, was not effective for pharyngeal NG. It is unknown if streptomycin's poor efficacy is indicative of limitations of aminoglycosides as a class. We plan to enroll 60 men who have sex with men in a demonstration study to be conducted at the Seattle & King County STD Clinic to test the efficacy of 360 mg of gentamicin given intramuscularly for pharyngeal gonorrhea. Secondary objectives include determining the ideal pharmacodynamic criterion (comparing in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of NG to peak gentamicin serum levels), estimating resistance induction among treatment failures, and assessing the tolerability of 360 mg of IM gentamicin.||Objectives||The proposed study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a single intramuscular (IM) dose of gentamicin in the treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea. Secondary objectives include documenting the efficacy stratified by minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) compared with the gentamicin peak level in order to estimate a pharmacodynamic criterion.

However, a standalone monovalent vaccine against S. sonnei could be used to protect travelers against diarrheal shigellosis, as the vast majority of travelers' shigellosis is caused by S. sonnei, and even to protect infants in endemic regions where shigellosis is primarily caused by S. sonnei.||The GSK3536852A vaccine has been tested in two Phase I dose escalation studies in Europe to assess its safety and immunogenicity via three routes of administration: intramuscular (IM), intranasal (IN) and intradermal (ID). The results from the first study (dose escalation with IM vaccination) have shown that the vaccine has an acceptable safety profile and is well-tolerated up to a dose of 100 micrograms (µg). The results from the second study (dose escalation with ID, IN and IM vaccination) showed that GSK3536852A vaccine is well-tolerated also when administered by the ID and IN routes of vaccination. However, immunogenicity data have shown that GSK3536852A vaccine administered by the ID and IN routes is not as immunogenic as GSK3536852A vaccine administered by the IM route. Therefore, it has been decided to proceed with the clinical development program of this vaccine only using the IM vaccination route. In terms of dosage, the regimen tested in Phase I studies (three doses given one month apart) did not show any significant benefit from the third dose in terms of immunogenicity, therefore a two dose schedule was selected for next studies.||A Phase IIa study, conducted in endemic regions of Africa (i.e., Kenya), has been completed and confirmed the acceptable safety profile and immunogenicity of GSK3536852A vaccine.||Performing this vaccine-human challenge study may give the opportunity to establish evidence of clinical protection induced by the candidate S. sonnei vaccine (GSK3536852A vaccine) at an early development stage.","Dysentery, Bacillary",Accept,439.0,"Biological,Drug",Phase 2,All,Prevention,Parallel Assignment,United States,Randomized,71.0,3,adults,1.0

Completed,"HIV/Tuberculosis (TB) co-infection have profound effects on the host's immune system. TB is the most common cause of death in patients with HIV worldwide. Rifamycins (such as rifampicin [RIF]) are an important component of TB therapy because of their unique activity. The problem is that most protease inhibitors (PI) and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) used to treat HIV have significant drug-drug interactions with RIF that can lead to reduced concentrations of these agents with risk of treatment failure or resistance. The non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) efavirenz (EFV) does not present the same significant drug interactions with RIF. EFV-based HIV treatment was tested in patients concomitantly treated with RIF-containing TB therapy, demonstrating that their co-administration can be used safely and effectively. However, the side effect profile of EFV overlaps with the RIF-containing TB regimens and makes the management of treatment toxicities very complex. Integrase inhibitors (INI), such as dolutegravir (DTG), may offer an important alternative to EFV-based therapy in TB coinfected patients. A Phase I drug-drug interaction study was conducted in healthy, HIV-seronegative subjects, and showed that DTG at 50 mg twice daily given together with RIF was well-tolerated and resulted in DTG concentrations similar to those of DTG 50 mg given once daily alone, which is the recommended dose for INI-naive patients. Therefore, ART regimens using DTG 50 mg twice daily may represent a new treatment option for TB-infected patients who require concurrent treatment for HIV infection. This is a Phase III b, randomized, open-label study describing the efficacy and safety of DTG and EFV-containing ART regimens in HIV/TB co-infected patients. This study is designed to assess the antiviral activity of DTG or efavirenz (EFV) ART-containing regimens through 48 weeks. A total of approximately 115 +/-5% subjects will be randomly assigned in a 3:2 ratio to DTG (approximately 69 subjects) and EFV (approximately 46 subjects), respectively. This study will include a Screening Period, a Randomized Phase (Day 1 to 48 weeks plus a 4-week extension), and a DTG Open-label extension (OLE).

Years of repeated infection with C. trachomatis cause the eyelid to scar and contract and ultimately to rotate inward such that the eyelashes rub against the eyeball and abrade the cornea (trichiasis). The World Health Organization (WHO) has endorsed a multi-faceted strategy to combat trachoma which includes surgery to repair lids distorted by trachoma (trichiasis) in imminent danger of vision loss. Current evidence suggests that long-term success rates of trichiasis surgery are less than optimal due to variation in surgical technique. Previous research by this study team has demonstrated that shorter incisions have a higher rate of trichiasis recurrence. In addition, observations by this team's oculoplastic surgeon have led to the hypothesis that granuloma formation and lid contour abnormalities may result from current surgical practices. The objective of this study is to compare outcomes of trichiasis surgeries performed with the newly developed trachomatous trichiasis (TT) clamp versus surgeries following standard technique (bilamellar tarsal rotation procedure or BLTR).",Trachoma,No,1127.0,"Device,Procedure",Not Applicable,All,Treatment,Parallel Assignment,United States,Randomized,1927.0,2,elderly-adults,0.0

Completed,"Shigellosis remains a serious and frequent disease throughout the world. Development of vaccines has been difficult because shigellae are habitants of and pathogens for humans only and there is no consensus about the mechanism(s) of immunity to this pathogen.||Incomplete, but compelling evidence, indicates that a critical level of serum IgG anti-LPS confers immunity to shigellosis. Important data come from our clinical trial in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) recruits. A randomized, double-blind, vaccine-controlled study showed that the S. sonnei-rEPA elicited 74% protection against shigellosis occurring about 3 months after vaccination (p=0.001). This vaccine conferred 43% (p=0.04) protection in one company during an outbreak up to 14 days following vaccination suggesting that our Shigella conjugates might be of value in epidemics. The efficacy of S. sonnei-rEPA was correlated with the level of vaccine-induced IgG antibodies.||The highest incidence, morbidity, and mortality of shigellosis is in young children. But serum antibody responsiveness to polysaccharide-based vaccines is age-dependent and infants and young children respond poorly or not at all to both disease and vaccination. The safety and immunogenicity of these Shigella conjugates in 4 to 6 years-old children in Israel was demonstrated. But although the fold rise in anti-LPS was similar in the children, the level of anti-LPS elicited by the conjugates was lower than in adults. We improved the immunogenicity of Shigella conjugates as shown in mice and then in adult humans. Now we apply to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy of these improved conjugates in 1 to 4 years-old children in Israel.||In Israel, shigellosis is common especially in children. S. sonnei (Group D) comprise about 60% of the isolates followed by S. flexneri (Group B): Shigella dysenteriae type 1 (Group A) is not found. We propose to administer 2 injections of either S. sonnei-CRM9 or S. flexneri type 2a-rEPAsucc 6 weeks apart in a random double-blind fashion to about 6,000 1 to 4 year-olds.

Terminated,"Clostridium difficile has become one of the leading causes of hospital acquired infections, and is associated with increased mortality. Patients with C. difficile associated disease (CDAD) possess deficiencies in 'normal' fecal microbial composition, most likely as a result of earlier antibiotic usage. The current standard of care treatment for severe C. difficile, which consists of antibiotics, does not restore the microbiota. Restoration of the normal colonic microbiota by fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) may enable reversion colonic microbial population to a more 'normal'state and lead to cure.||A few patients develop severe CDAD which may be complicated by adynamic ileus, or toxic megacolon. The management in this context is based on limited data, and for some the only available option is sub-total colectomy.||Although FMT is by no means a new therapeutic modality, there is limited information on its use for the treatment of acute CDAD, including severe CDAD. Because of the high morbidity and mortality associated with treatment of patients with severe CDAD, and because the evidence supporting the current recommendations is weak and based upon the demonstration that FMT is an effective strategy to re-establish a balanced intestinal microbiota with resultant cure of recurrent CDAD, we propose to study the efficacy and safety of FMT for severe CDAD.||Patients with severe CDAD can be divided into two operational groups; those that have diarrhea and those that suffer from adynamic ileus.

Completed,"Autoinflammatory diseases are illnesses characterized by episodes of inflammation that, unlike autoimmune disorders, lack the production of high titer autoantibodies or antigen-specific T cells. There is growing genetic and clinical evidence that Interleukin-1 (IL-1) plays a pathogenic role in several of these diseases. This exploratory study aims to examine the utility of the experimental drug candidate, IL 1 Trap (Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) in the treatment of adult subjects with the autoinflammatory disorders Neonatal Onset Multisystem Inflammatory Disease (NOMID), Muckle-Wells Syndrome (MWS), and Familial Cold Autoinflammatory Syndrome (FCAS), Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), and adult Still's disease. FMF is associated with mutations in pyrin encoding MEFV. NOMID, MWS and FCAS are associated with mutations in cryopyrin-encoding CIAS1.||This pilot study is designed to address: 1) the utility of IL 1 Trap in the treatment of subjects with diseases known to respond to IL-1 blockade (NOMID/MWS/FCAS) as shown by response to treatment with anakinra [Kineret]; 2) the response to IL-1 blockade of subjects with Adult Still's disease and colchicine-resistant FMF once the efficacy of IL-1 Trap has been established in NOMID/MWS/FCAS subjects; and 3) the biochemistry and genetics of autoinflammatory diseases and IL-1 related inflammation.||IL-1 Trap is a recombinant fusion protein with picomolar affinity for IL-1 and a half-life of approximately 7.5 days in humans. This agent is currently in Phase 2 clinical studies for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and initial studies have shown activity against clinical and biochemical indicators of inflammation. Compared with anakinra, this agent may exhibit improved dosing convenience, potential for fewer injection site reactions, and improved efficacy due to the extremely high affinity of IL-1Trap for its target.||In this study, biochemical, genetic, and clinical correlates of autoinflammatory disease will initially be measured at baseline following a withdrawal of any TNF or IL-1 inhibitor medications where applicable. Subjects will receive a course of therapy with IL-1 Trap that is predicted to provide an estimated 3-4 weeks of anti-inflammatory activity. Clinical, biochemical, and genetic correlates of inflammation will be measured at appropriate intervals to ascertain response and to further elucidate disease mechanisms. Subjects will be eligible, based on clinical response, to enter a 1- year extension phase with IL-1 Trap. Those subjects who complete the 1-year extension phase, and maintain improved clinical and laboratory parameters compared to baseline values, may continue to receive study medication at their current dose until the study drug is commercially available.||Investigator comment:||This protocol (from the NIH standpoint) is a continuation of the ongoing protocol 05-AR-0014, with a new change in study sponsor, the NIH replacing Regeneron as sponsor. this protocol therefore still contains background and procedural information that refer to patients with FMF and FCAS and or MWS and Still's disease, however only patients with Still's disease will be newly enrolled from this point on, enrollment for the FCAS and or MWS patients has already been completed and it has been decided to not enroll any more FMF patients because the number of subjects is too low to reach reasonable conclusions, in addition it has been difficult to recruit patients that are eligible.

There are 5-15% of patients who continue to have FMF attacks despite treatment with colchicine or who cannot tolerate colchicine. Currently there are no alternatives to colchicine. Pyrin, the protein that has a defect in FMF has an important role in the regulation of a molecule called interleukin (IL)-1 beta production and activity. This molecule is very important in the process of inflammation in FMF.||Therefore we propose to use IL-1 Trap (Rilonacept), a medication that binds and neutralizes IL-1.||We will enroll in this study 17 subjects from the age of 4 years, including adults with active FMF despite colchicine therapy.

Also, monoclonal antibodies, such as alemtuzumab, can find cancer cells and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.

Completed,"This study will investigate the safety and effectiveness of a modified donor stem cell transplantation procedure for treating advanced mycosis fungoides (MF), a lymphoma primarily affecting the skin, and Sezary syndrome (SS), a leukemic form of the disease. Donated stem cells (cells produced by the bone marrow that mature into the different blood components white cells, red cells and platelets) can cure patients with certain leukemias and lymphomas and multiple myeloma. These cells generate a completely new, functioning bone marrow. In addition, immune cells from the donor grow and generate a new immune system to help fight infections. The new immune cells also attack any residual tumor cells left in the body after intensive chemotherapy. However, stem cell transplantation carries a significant risk of death, because it requires completely suppressing the immune system with high-dose chemotherapy and radiation. In addition, lymphocytes from the donor may cause what is called graft vs. host disease (GvHD), in which these cells see the patient s cells as foreign and mount an immune response to destroy them. To try to reduce these risks, patients in this study will be given low-dose chemotherapy and no radiation, a regimen that is easier for the body to tolerate and involves a shorter period of complete immune suppression. In addition, a monoclonal antibody called Campath-1H will be given to target lymphocytes, including those that have become cancerous.||Patients with advanced MF or SS who are between 18 and 70 years of age and have a matched family donor 18 years of age or older may be eligible for this study. Candidates will have a medical history, physical examination and blood tests, lung and heart function tests, X-rays of the chest, eye examination, and bone marrow sampling (withdrawal through a needle of about a tablespoon of marrow from the hip bone), and small skin biopsy (surgical removal of a piece of tissue for microscopic examination) or needle biopsy of the tumor.||Stem cells will be collected from both the patient and donor. To do this, the hormone G-CSF will be injected under the skin for several days to push stem cells out of the bone marrow into the bloodstream. Then, the stem cells will be collected by apheresis. In this procedure the blood is drawn through a needle placed in one arm and pumped into a machine where the required cells are separated out and removed. The rest of the blood is returned through a needle in the other arm.||Before the transplant, a central venous line (large plastic tube) is placed into a major vein. This tube can stay in the body and be used the entire treatment period to deliver the donated stem cells, give medications, transfuse blood, if needed, and withdraw blood samples. Several days before the transplant procedure, patients will start a conditioning regimen of low-dose chemotherapy with Campath 1H, fludarabine, and, if necessary, cyclophosphamide. When the conditioning therapy is completed, the stem cells will be infused over a period of up to 4 hours. To help prevent rejection of donor cells and GvHD, cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil will be given by mouth or by vein for about 3 months starting 4 days before the transplantation.||The anticipated hospital stay is 3 to 4 days, when the first 3 doses of Campath will be monitored for drug side effects. The rest of the procedures, including the transplant, can be done on an outpatient basis. Follow-up visits for the first 3 months after the transplant will be scheduled once or twice a week for a physical examination, blood tests and symptoms check. Then, visits will be scheduled at 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, and 48 months post-transplant. Visits for the first 3 years will include blood tests, skin biopsies, and bone marrow biopsies.",Mycosis Fungoides|Sezary Syndrome,No,6022.0,"Other,Drug",Phase 1|Phase 2,All,Treatment,Single Group Assignment,United States,SingleArmNA,5.0,4,elderly-adults,7.0

Score system have been developed to identify groups at very high risk for the development of candidemia/invasive candidiasis in the ICU. These scoring system have used clinical information with or without data on Candida colonization, and have shown reasonable correlation with candidemia/invasive candidiasis. More recently, a biomarker - detection of 1,3-beta-D-glucan in the serum - has been tested in the early diagnosis of candidiasis. The incorporation of biomarkers such as beta-D-glucan could help clinicians to select a group at higher risk for candidemia, and despite the fact that these tests may give false-positive results, their negative predictive value could be of great help.||Therefore, the objectives of this study are:||To assess the frequency of positive biomarkers in ICU patients at high risk to develop invasive candidiasis/candidemia;|To test the strategy of early discontinuation of antifungal therapy based on repeatedly negative blood cultures and 1,3 beta-D-glucan in the serum.",Candidemia,No,395.0,Drug,Phase 4,All,Treatment,Single Group Assignment,Brazil,SingleArmNA,85.0,1,elderly-adults,0.0

Completed,"Joint replacement is becoming an increasingly common procedure. In 2005, 534,000 total knee arthroplasties (TKA) were performed in the United States which is at a rate of 18.1 per 10,000 individuals, and the demand for primary TKA is projected to grow by 673% by 2030. Effective post-operative analgesia is an important component with regards to patient satisfaction and hospital stay. Regional anesthesia has been shown to decrease duration of surgery, need for transfusion, post-operative nausea and vomiting, and the incidence of thromboembolic disease in patients undergoing total knee or total hip replacement when compared with general anesthesia. Post-operatively, regional anesthesia has been shown to reduce pain scores and/or morphine consumption as well as opioid-related adverse effects.||Epidural catheter or spinal anesthesia has become the standard of care at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for intraoperative management of TKA patients. General anesthesia is still occasionally used for patients that would strongly prefer a general anesthetic, those that are taking anticoagulation medications or with a coagulopathy, those with previous back surgery, and those with certain neurologic conditions such as multiple sclerosis or spina bifida. Comparison studies between lumbar epidural analgesia and femoral nerve catheters (FNC) for postoperative analgesia following TKA show no significant difference in pain scores, morphine consumption, or post-operative nausea and vomiting. However, epidural analgesia has been associated with higher incidence of hypotension and urinary retention. FNC's placed for postoperative pain allow patients to ambulate more effectively as there should not be much of a lower extremity motor block. Patients with a FNC for postoperative analgesia also do not require a urinary catheter which eliminates a common source of infection in postoperative patients. FNCs have also demonstrated improved rehabilitation times and decreased hospital stays which has led to an increased insertion rate of FNCs for postoperative analgesia following TKA at the University of Wisconsin.||Pyarthrosis is a fairly common complication occurring at a rate of 2% following primary and 5.6% following revision TKA. Infection can be a devastating complication following implantation of joint hardware often leading to extended hospitalization/rehabilitation stays and return trips to the operating room. The average billed charges for all types of revision TKA procedures was $49,360 with average length of stay of 5.1 days. Indwelling lines are a known infection risk and indwelling lines in the femoral region are known to be associated with a high incidence of catheter colonization. At 48 hours, Cuvillon et. al. found that 57% of FNCs placed without the use of a chlorhexidine impregnated patch had positive bacterial colonization. They also described three cases of transient bacteremia secondary to FNCs in the 208 catheters that they analyzed.||Chlorhexidine impregnated patches also known as ""biopatches"" have been shown to reduce the incidence of bacterial colonization and infection of various indwelling lines including epidurals and central venous catheters. Currently no standard of care exists that requires the use of biopatches for FNCs. The investigators propose studying the use of the biopatch to reduce the incidence of bacterial colonization of femoral nerve catheters.||The investigators will study the efficacy of the biopatch at decreasing the rate of bacterial colonization of FNCs in TKA patients. The FNCs will be inserted in the standard fashion and removed at the end of therapy. Typically the FNC infusion will continue until the morning of post-operation day (POD) #1 or 2. The process for FNC insertion first involves sterile prep and drape of the femoral region. Full sterile technique will be utilized including gown, gloves, and mask. Ultrasound guidance is then commonly utilized to identify the femoral nerve. Following patient sedation and skin infiltration with local anesthetic, a tuohy needle is inserted adjacent to the femoral nerve. A catheter is then threaded through the needle in close proximity to the femoral nerve. Patients will be randomized to either no chlorhexidine impregnated patch or to a chlorhexidine impregnated patch that will be located at the catheter exit site. On the morning of POD 1 or 2, the FNC infusion will be discontinued. Typically, Twenty-four to forty-eight hours after catheter insertion, it will be removed in a sterile fashion and the skin surrounding the catheter exit site will be swabbed and the distal catheter tip will be sent for culture to determine bacterial colonization. In addition, the investigators will interview patients and review clinical data to determine signs of infection and/or catheter tip colonization rates.","Catheter Infections|Spinal Catheter (Epidural) (Subdural); Complications, Infection or Inflammation",No,244.0,Device,Phase 4,All,Prevention,Parallel Assignment,United States,Randomized,100.0,1,elderly-adults,0.0

In a pilot study, the investigators performed a randomized trial of 230 healthcare workers and demonstrated no difference in total bacterial colony counts or identification of pathogenic bacteria from the gloves of persons who either performed HH or did not perform HH prior to putting on non-sterile gloves.

Completed,"The investigators propose a randomized controlled clinical trial to determine the comparative effectiveness of chlorhexidine-alcohol and iodine-alcohol preoperative skin preparation for preventing surgical site infections at cesarean section. While estimates vary, surgical site infections complicate up to 5 - 10% of all cesarean sections and result in significant human suffering and excess health care costs. Interventions such as preoperative antibiotic prophylaxis reduce surgical site infections by 60%, but the rate of infection remains high. There is therefore a great need to identify and test other potential interventions to further reduce these infections.||The skin is a major source of pathogens that cause surgical site infection. Therefore, optimizing preoperative skin antisepsis has the potential to decrease postoperative surgical site infections. There is paucity of evidence to guide the choice of antiseptic for skin preparation at cesarean section. To date, only two underpowered trials have been published comparing two methods of preoperative skin preparation at cesarean section. A recent randomized trial in adults undergoing clean-contaminated mostly general surgical procedures demonstrated a 41% reduction in surgical site infection with the use of chlorhexidine-alcohol when compared to the more commonly used povidone-iodine.

Completed,"Background: Over 1 million intravitreal injections are performed annually in the United States. The most devastating complication related to these injections is endophthalmitis, with an incidence of 0.02 - 0.1% per injection. Techniques aimed at prevention of this complication have been studied, though emergence rates of antibiotic resistant bacteria in a single clinic population comparing antiseptic technique with iodine vs. use of post-injection second generation fluoroquinolones has not been reported in the literature.|Objectives: The purpose of the study is to help determine the best way to prevent infection and limit antibiotic resistance in patients receiving eye injections.|Procedures Involved (Research Interventions): After the patient is chosen based on inclusion criteria and agrees to participate in the study, exclusion criteria will be reviewed, cognizance will be determined, informed consent and HIPAA compliance forms will be signed. At this point and prior to the instillation of ophthalmic medications, a Rayon swab will be passed along the inferior fornix of the study eye while the patient looks up and the examiner lowers the lower eyelid. The swab will then be used to inoculate chocolate agar and a blood agar culture plates and a glass slide. These will be brought to the FMO microbiology department for culture and Gram stain. All Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative Staphylococcus species identified will be subjected to sensitivity testing using the Gram Positive antibiotic panel available at Loma Linda, with the addition of ciprofloxacin.",Bacterial Resistance,No,578.0,Drug,Not Applicable,All,Screening,Parallel Assignment,United States,Non-Randomized,120.0,2,elderly-adults,0.0
Completed,"BioFire Diagnostics, LLC (BioFire) has developed the FilmArray Gastrointestinal (GI) Panel, a rapid, easy to use PCR-based in vitro diagnostic test for the identification of 22 common microorganisms responsible for infectious gastroenteritis (http://filmarray.com/the-panels/) from a stool specimen collected in Cary Blair enteric transport media. The test was made available for sale in the US and EU following FDA clearance and CE marking in May, 2014.||The FilmArray GI Panel offers improvements over conventional laboratory testing which include: reduced turnaround time from specimen to result, reduced laboratory labor costs, increased sensitivity and specificity relative to current clinical reference methods, and larger breadth of organism identification than is available using standard methods. Because of these attributes, the results from this test have the potential to enable clinicians to more accurately diagnose and treat GI illness in a reduced time frame.||Collaborators at the University of Utah, Brown University/Lifespan, and BioFire Diagnostics have designed a study to evaluate health outcomes of pediatric subjects presenting to emergency departments with GI illness before and after establishing the FilmArray GI Panel as the standard of care method for stool pathogen analysis. It is hypothesized that the rapid (~ 1 hour turnaround time), sensitive, specific, and comprehensive results provided by the FilmArray GI Panel will allow clinicians to more rapidly diagnose GI illness, initiate appropriate therapy and provide guidance when compared to the pre-implementation period.",Infectious Gastroenteritis,No,488.0,Device,Not Applicable,All,Diagnostic,Parallel Assignment,United States,Non-Randomized,1545.0,1,adults-infants,0.0

Terminated,"This study will determine if the drug infliximab is safe for treating inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in patients with chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). IBD is an inflammation or irritation of the gut that leads to symptoms such as diarrhea, bloating and stomach cramps. CGD is an inherited disease affecting white blood cells called neutrophils in which patients are susceptible to repeated bacterial and fungal infections. They also have a higher incidence of some autoimmune diseases, such as IBD. Infliximab is approved to treat Crohn's disease, an IBD similar to that seen in patients with CGD.||Patients 10 years of age and older with CGD and IBD may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood and urine tests, electrocardiogram (EKG), tuberculosis skin test (PPD skin testing), and stool test for the presence of infections. Additional tests may be done, including colonoscopy (procedure using a flexible tube through the rectum to examine the lining of the gut) and imaging studies such as an x-ray, chest CT scan (test using a special x-ray machine), MRI (test using a magnetic field and radio waves), and barium studies (study using a drinkable solution of barium to help enhance the x-ray pictures of the gut).||Participants are divided into patients with IBD symptoms (Group 1) and patients without IBD symptoms (Group 2) for the following procedures:||Group 1||Patients are evaluated every 6 months with a medical history and physical examination for signs and symptoms of IBD. Patients who are taking moderate to high doses of steroid medications have their medication slowly lowered (tapered) and are evaluated every 3 months for a total of 2 years. Patients in this group who start to develop IBD symptoms are moved to Group 2 for treatment with infliximab (see below).||Group 2||Patients in Group 2 receive infliximab infusions at 2-week intervals for three doses. The drug is given over a 2-hour period through a catheter placed in a vein. Patients are evaluated with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests the day of each dose. One week after the last dose, they have another evaluation, including a colonoscopy. Patients who respond well to infliximab may continue to receive the drug every 2 months for a total of 1 year, with evaluations at every dosing visit. At the end of the first year of receiving infliximab, all patients have follow-up evaluations every 6 months for a total of 2 years.||Group 3||Subjects who volunteer to undergo colonoscopy and research biopsies that serve as controls for evaluation of the patient gut samples.",Chronic Granulomatous Disease|Crohn'S-like IBD|Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD),Accept,2223.0,Drug,Phase 1|Phase 2,All,Treatment,Single Group Assignment,United States,Non-Randomized,40.0,1,elderly-childTeen,2.0

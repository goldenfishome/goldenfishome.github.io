Apart from this infection, they are associated with thrombocytopenia, obstetric complications, thrombosis and heart valve damage. These conditions have also been described as complications during Q fever. In a retrospective preliminary work on Q fever, we have shown that the presence of high levels of IgG anti-cardiolipin was associated with the presence of valvular and the evolution to endocarditis.

3008,"Recruiting","TB remains the foremost infectious disease killer globally. A startling statistic is that two out of every five TB cases globally (40%) remain undiagnosed and untreated. These 'missed' or undiagnosed cases are disproportionately concentrated in large peri-urban 'slums' and informal settlements of large cities in Africa and Asia (they are frequently minimally symptomatic but remain infectious).||The lack of a sensitive low cost same-day test represented a major challenge to active community-based case finding (ACF) compared to the current model where patients 'self-seek' care (passive case finding). More recently, sensitive TB DNA-detection tests called Gene Xpert (Xpert) have become available. This is a nucleic acid amplification test-based technology which can rule-in a diagnosis of TB in two thirds of smear negative pulmonary TB cases. GeneXpert® has now been rolled out in many African countries and is the frontline TB test in primary care clinics in South Africa. The investigators recently showed that GeneXpert® significantly reduced the time to treatment initiation in the setting of passive case finding (elaborated in next section). The investigators further showed that GeneXpert® can be performed by a minimally trained healthcare worker. However, historically technical and logistical demands meant that the GeneXpert® MTB-RIF assay was not ideally suited to use at point of care and in South Africa it is still centrally located.||Small portable battery-operated versions of these tests are now available (EDGE, GeneXpert two-module mobile platform). The investigators conducted a large study in South Africa and Zimbabwe (published in 2016) that showed that using the old non-portable version of Xpert on a mini-truck equipped with a generator was feasible and highly effective for ACF. A subsequent study funded by the American government (XACT II), showed that using the portable version of Xpert on the back of a small low-cost scalable panel van (in effect a mobile mini-clinic) was feasible and had a very high pick-up rate of TB in peri-urban communities (~10% of those undergoing targeted screening). In this study, the investigators will test the hypothesis that community-based active case finding (ACF) using Gene Xpert Edge (in a low cost scalable mini-mobile clinic) performed at point-of-care (POC) is feasible and more effective (lower proportion of TB cases failing to initiate treatment especially if they are 'super-spreaders' i.e. highly infectious) than Xpert performed in a centralised laboratory.","Tuberculosis","No","Interventional","March 26, 2021","December 1, 2024","GeneXpert Edge|GeneXpert Ultra","Other|Other","Not Applicable","All","70 Years","18 Years","Screening","Parallel Assignment","Mozambique|South Africa|Zambia|Zimbabwe","Randomized","3375",,

The bladder of SCI patients, especially those with indwelling catheters, is usually colonized by bacteria, some of which do and others which do not cause symptoms of UTI. Bacteria that do not cause symptoms are often called benign colonizers and are often left untreated because they may provide some protection against infection with more harmful bacteria. This idea of using benign bacteria to prevent infections with symptoms is called bacterial interference. A prototype strain, Escherichia coli 83972, was shown to begin and continue for extended periods of time non symptom causing colonization of the human bladder and to hold back symptom causing infections of the neurogenic bladder. Data from pilot studies at two medical centers indicated that bacterial interference might be a useful therapy for reducing the rate or frequency of UTI in SCI patients. Because almost all SCI patients have a UTI at some time, and also the large costs of treating this infection, studying the impact of bladder colonization with E. coli 83972 on the rate of symptom causing UTI has an amazing potential for improving the quality of life of SCI patients and decreasing the cost of health care.

New, more effective drugs with less side effects are therefore urgently needed to solve this problem. Although several new drugs against TB are in the pipeline, physicians currently have limited treatment options for treatment of complicated MDR/XDR-TB cases. Therefore, drugs developed and labeled for other infectious diseases are evaluated for TB.||Objective:||The main objective of this prospective clinical trial is to evaluate pharmacokinetics of a standard dose (2000mg) of ertapenem in TB patients. This clinical trial will provide important information on PK of ertapenem in TB patients for future studies. Data can be used for limited sampling strategies for ertapenem based on a pharmacokinetic population model constructed from the full PK curves of the patients.||Study design:||A prospective pharmacokinetic study.||Study population: 12 TB patients.||Intervention: Single dose of 2000mg in a 30 minutes intravenous infusion.||Main study parameters/endpoints:||The pharmacokinetic parameters (Vd, Cl, AUC, etc) of ertapenem are the primary endpoints of the study.

A prognostic correlate of risk (COR), based on messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression signatures, which prospectively discriminates between TB cases and healthy controls, has been constructed and validated. Based on published microarray case-control datasets, the COR has 87% diagnostic sensitivity and 97% specificity for prevalent TB disease; and in two nested case-control studies, 70% prognostic sensitivity and 84% specificity for incident TB disease occurring within one year of sampling (HIV uninfected persons). Diagnostic and prognostic performance of the COR has not yet been tested in a prospective cohort.||COR+ status is not directly associated with LTBI; and may, or may not, be amenable to preventive therapy. Although effective in the short-term, preventive therapy is not recommended for treatment of LTBI in HIV uninfected adults living in high TB burden countries, due to rapid loss of protection; and treatment burden. A 3-month, 12-dose, once-weekly preventive therapy regimen of high dose Isoniazid (INH) and Rifapentine (3HP) has been recommended as equivalent to 6 months of daily INH for treatment of LTBI in low TB burden countries by the World Health Organization (WHO).||A 'screen & treat' strategy, based on serial mass campaigns to provide targeted, short-course preventive therapy only to COR+ persons at highest risk of TB disease, may offer the solution for durable, community-wide protection in high TB burden countries.

3093,"Completed","Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and HIV are leading causes of disease and death in Subsaharan Africa. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) dramatically improves prognosis in HIV infection, but TB is still a common complication in HIV-infected subjects. Management of TB-HIV co-infection is complex, both with regard to diagnosis and treatment. Since scaling-up of ART requires management of most patients in primary health care, it is critical to achieve better strategies for TB-HIV co-infection at peripheral levels of the health care system in endemic regions. This includes development of new methods to assess the severity of HIV disease and the need to start ART during TB treatment in this population.||Aims: To compare a scoring system for clinical signs of immunosuppression with CD4 cell counts to assess HIV disease severity and indications for ART initiation, and to correlate immunosuppression status with treatment outcome.||Workplan: CD4 cell levels and results of clinical scoring has been compared in 1100 patients with TB, using HIV-negative subjects with TB treatment for control. Inclusion was closed in February 2012, and follow-up of participants completed in August 2012. Plasma levels of immune activation and inflammatory markers will be correlated with the degree of immunosuppression.||Significance: TB is the most significant clinical challenge to the successful scaling-up of ART in Africa. In order to improve management in primary health care it is necessary to find robust and reliable techniques for determining disease severity and identification of patients who need to start ART during TB treatment. This study may contribute to increased knowledge in this field and help to modify guidelines for management of TB-HIV co-infection in Ethiopia as well as in other resource-limited settings.","HIV Infection|Tuberculosis|Immunosuppression","No","Observational","September 2010","January 2014",,,,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Ethiopia|Ethiopia|Ethiopia|Ethiopia|Ethiopia",,"1200",,

Many published studies have shown a surprisingly high proportion of all patients initiated on ART dying within 6 months (8-26%) with increasing risk with decreasing CD4 T cell count. The majority (median 70%) occur in the first 3 months with the greatest proportion of deaths due to previously undiagnosed tuberculosis (TB). The investigators will enroll patients from 4 geographically diverse countries (Gabon, Mozambique, South Africa, and Uganda) in a randomized open label clinical trial targeting a population of people with high mortality risk; patients with CD4 T cell count < 50 cells/μl and body mass index (BMI) < 18 kg/m2. Severely immunocompromised patients with low BMI in the intervention arm will receive presumptive anti-TB 4-drug chemotherapy and subsequently initiate ART within 2 weeks compared to ART alone. The main objective is to measure and compare early mortality in the group presumptively treated for TB in addition to ART. Other sub-objectives are to determine the predictors of early mortality and the causes of death by autopsy (traditional and verbal), to determine if presumptive anti-TB treatment affects viral suppression with ART, and to assess incidence rates and characterize drug toxicity in patients dually treated. Because of the high rates of TB co-infection in sub-Saharan Africa in the HIV-infected, the investigators expect that patients presumptively treated for TB in addition to HIV will have a lower mortality rate than patients receiving ART only.

In order to protect the few available drugs that are left, ensuring adequate plasma concentrations of the drugs are important. Individualized therapy using plasma drug concentrations and minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) determination may be of importance (1). The plasma drug concentrations and the MICs of the second-line drugs will be compared, aiming at increasing the knowledge about pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) indices in the treatment of MDR-TB. In the future, the aim is an individualised therapy, where sub-therapeutic drug concentrations can be adjusted by the use of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM). TDM in the treatment of MDR-TB may improve clinical outcome for the patients, but plasma concentrations must be assessed together with clinical and microbiological factors (2).||In this observational study the hypothesis is that the ratio between drug concentrations and MICs of the anti-tuberculous drugs, are correlated to the time to sputum culture conversion, the bacterial load measured as time to positive liquid culture (TTP) and clinical outcome. Consenting adult patients with pulmonary MDR-TB patients in China will be recruited. MIC-determination of Mycobacterium tuberculosis will be performed in BACTEC 960 MGIT and drug concentration will be determined at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after treatment initiation using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), simultaneously assessing Dried Blood Spot (DBS) as a bio-sampling method.

3209,"Not yet recruiting","Tuberculosis (TB) has been one of the top 10 causes of death worldwide from a single infectious agent, ranking above HIV/AIDS. Management and eradication of this disease is being hindered by the emergence of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and extensively drug resistant TB (XDR-TB). Globally, there were estimated 10.4 million cases of TB and 490,000 cases of MDR-TB in 2016. China accounts for around 8.6% (0.895/10.4 million) of the global TB burden, ranking third in the top 3 countries (India, Indonesia, China) with the highest number of TB cases and ranking first with the largest number of MDR/ Rifampin-Resistant (RR)-TB cases. The treatment success rate for MDR-TB using the 18-24-month conventional World Health Organization (WHO) regimen was estimated to be about 54% worldwide and 41% for China in 2016, which remains unacceptably low.||The poor MDR-TB treatment success rates suggest that current drug regimens are suboptimal. In addition, they are costly with a high pill burden, as many drugs, with significant potential for adverse events, are given for a long duration. These factors also inhibit good treatment compliance with further negative impact on treatment outcomes. According to previous studies, treatment outcomes of MDR-TB could be affected by drug resistance of pivotal drugs in MDR-TB regimen, such as fluoroquinolones, second-line injectable agents and pyrazinamide. The available drug-resistance information could help physicians decide the proper regimens for MDR-TB patients, which may prevent the useless prescription and evitable adverse.||Therefore, the individualized regimen based on the resistance profile of the bacteria and patients' drug tolerance should be aimed for high-quality treatment for MDR-TB in the future. A precision individualized treatment approach based on the rapid molecular drug susceptibility tests of second line drugs may assist clinicians in making more suitable regimen and improve the treatment outcome of MDR-TB. Also, precision regimen offers the opportunity to improve treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis through reduced toxicity while reducing the risk of resistance amplification and further transmission at a population level.||The purpose of this research is to assess the feasibility and effects of individualized regimen that is guided by rapid molecular drug susceptibility tests of key second-line drugs through next generation sequencing.

The most effective way to reduce TB incidence and mortality is to interrupt transmission. This requires finding and treating individuals with TB disease early, including those with subclinical disease. Molecular epidemiologic studies and mathematical models have shown that the primary approach to case finding-household contact tracing-identifies only 8-19% of transmissions in high TB and TB/HIV burden settings. Thus there is a clear need to identify new groups and settings where TB transmission occurs. Spatial clustering of individuals with higher rates of progression from infection to disease, such as those with HIV and malnourishment, can also form transmission hotspots. Illicit drug (i.e., methamphetamines, crack/cocaine, opiates) users have higher TB infection prevalence and disease incidence compared to non-users, likely due to significant within-group transmission and/or clustered vulnerability. Increased transmission among people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) could result from creation of more efficient TB transmitters, increased close contact among transmitters, increased rates of primary progression from infection to disease among contacts, or a combination. Interrogation of illicit drug user networks for TB transmission, therefore, holds great potential as a target for early case identification and linkage to treatment, with potential benefit for halting transmission to the broader population.","Tuberculosis|Illicit Drug Use","No","Observational","April 22, 2021","April 2024","Smoked illicit drug use","Behavioral",,"All",,"15 Years",,,"South Africa",,"800",,

Although several new drugs against TB are in the pipeline, physicians currently have limited treatment options for treatment of complicated MDR/XDR-TB cases. Therefore, drugs developed and labeled for other infectious diseases are evaluated for TB. Co-trimoxazole consists of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Sulfamethoxazole could be effective in the treatment of tuberculosis as shown by Forgacs et al. and Huang et al.||Furthermore, with dried blood spot (DBS) analysis, the exposure to co-trimoxazole could be analyzed with only some blood drops withdrawn with a finger prick on paper.

There is compelling clinical evidence suggesting that integrating HIV and TB services saves lives and presents an effective and efficient use of resources directed at optimizing health outcomes. Quality improvement (QI) methods are increasingly being used to systematically test and incorporate local ideas into strategies for reliable implementation and scale up. This trial is designed to test a practical, implementable and affordable strategy aimed at improving HIV-TB service integration to reduce TB and HIV associated deaths. This is a cluster randomized controlled trial, which evaluates and tests the effectiveness of implementing a QI model to integrate HIV-TB service delivery in primary health care clinics, on reducing morbidity and mortality in TB-HIV co-infected patients. This study will be conducted in 2 districts, Ugu and uThungulu, in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. The model of integrated care delivery for TB and HIV using the QI method offers a systems approach to care delivery to directly enhance treatment outcomes by enabling comprehensive effective care designed around the patients journey from entry to the clinic, through screening treatment initiation, treatment completion, and retention in care that is directed at the goals of cure for TB, effective sustainable HIV viral suppression and reduced HIV associated TB mortality as the main health impact. The scalability of the model, once proven effective, is the critical element that makes it increase population coverage of quality diagnosis and treatment of HIV-TB co-infection. QI methods promote front line staff engagement in identification and rapid testing of local implementation solutions to gaps in performance of processes of care along the steps of the patient journey. Gaps in care are identified through continuous feedback on a core set of indicators collected monthly as routine collection of data.","HIV|Tuberculosis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","June 1, 2015","December 30, 2020","Quality Improvement Model of Care","Other","Not Applicable","All",,,"Health Services Research","Parallel Assignment","South Africa","Randomized","8000",,
3239,"Completed","Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is a well studied clinical intervention for primary and secondary prevention of active tuberculosis (TB) after infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. It is widely used in industrialized countries in TB outbreak management, focusing on high risk groups such as close contacts in the family, in congregate settings, and in the workplace amongst others. Individuals infected with Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) have a markedly higher risk of acquiring a TB-infection and developing consequently active TB, making HIV-infected individuals a target population for IPT. Studies of IPT in HIV infected persons in the nineties demonstrated the efficacy of IPT in the prevention of active TB in Sub -Saharan Africa and more recent studies suggest that the protective effect remains present in individuals on antiretroviral therapy.||Despite the proven efficacy of IPT this intervention has not been taken up by most HIV and TB control programmes in Africa where the burden of TB/HIV is highest. The reasons for the low uptake of IPT are many and varied but include fears of expansion of isoniazid resistance and subsequently the development of multi -drug resistant TB with widespread use of IPT. Additionally screening protocols for excluding active TB and selecting persons for IPT have not been uniformly agreed upon. There have also been concerns that programmes designed to provide IPT may shift TB control programmes from their primary responsibility of finding and treating active TB. Finally it has been unclear as to which programme, between the HIV and the TB control programme, has the primary responsibility of managing the provision of the IPT intervention.||The World Health Organization and other technical agencies engaged in global TB control have recently re-emphasized the need to scale up IPT. In this proposal we outline an operational research study to evaluate the introduction of IPT at community level and to measure its effectiveness at preventing TB. The study is based on the context of expansion of Community-Based Direct Observed Therapy Short Course (CB-DOTS), home-based care and the concept of HIV prevention with positives (PwPs), where there is a real opportunity to focus on the household as a source of HIV-associated tuberculosis.||The study is designed as a cluster randomized trial. It compares the incidence of TB in household contacts including children under 5 of identified TB/HIV co-infected patients, who received IPT through proactive community intervention and those in a control group where the community was handled in the ""usual way"". In the intervention group household contacts of index cases of HIV positive, smear positive PTB will be visited at home and consenting contacts will be screened for active TB using a simple questionnaire. Those found to be fit will receive isoniazid 300mg (5 mg per Kg for children) once daily for 6 months, regardless of the HIV-status. Those found not to be fit will be referred for further evaluation at the nearest TB diagnostic centre. In the control group, routine care following national guidelines will be offered. This consists of contact invitation and assessment of eligibility for IPT, especially, in children less than 5 years. Both groups will be followed up monthly through household visits. Follow up will be for a total of 24 months including the six months when IPT is provided.||A confidential HIV screening test will be provided to all consenting contacts in both intervention and control group after appropriate counseling.||The primary outcome is the incidence of TB in the intervention and control household contacts. The difference in incidence between the two groups is a measure of efficacy of the intervention. In addition the efficacy of the intervention will be estimated stratified by HIV status of household contacts if data allows. Secondary outcomes are the incidence of adverse events, the incidence of TB-related symptoms, measures on the uptake of IPT (proportion of contacts starting and discontinuing IPT, treatment adherence) and programmatic indicators, i.e. percentage of persons eligible for IPT and resources needed.","Tuberculosis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","April 2009","November 2012","community IPT","Other","Phase 4","All",,"15 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya|Kenya","Randomized","1259",,

3248,"Completed","Rationale: The Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine protects children against disseminated tuberculosis (TB) including TB meningitis and miliary TB, but efficacy against pulmonary TB is inconsistent among children and adults. Administration of live attenuated BCG to infants known to be HIV infected is contraindicated by the World Health Organization (WHO), due to the risk of serious vaccine adverse events (BCG disease. Developing countries, which lack capacity for integration of early infant HIV testing with infant vaccination schedules, have not fully implemented the WHO guidelines on BCG vaccination of HIV exposed infants. Newborn infants of HIV infected mothers continue to receive routine BCG before HIV infection has been excluded.||Clinical trials of new viral-vectored TB vaccines, including MVA85A, a modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vaccine expressing the Mycobacterium tuberculosis antigen 85A, have to date enrolled infants who were already vaccinated with routine BCG at birth. However, TB vaccination regimens that depend on newborn BCG will remain unsafe for HIV infected infants. Infants of HIV infected mothers, who constituted 29% of babies born in South Africa in 2009, would benefit from a new TB vaccination strategy, in which BCG is delayed until after HIV infection has been excluded. These HIV exposed infants also have greater increased risk of TB disease. Testing the safety and immunogenicity of MVA85A vaccine prime, followed by selective delayed BCG boost, in HIV exposed newborns, is a critical step towards delivery of a new TB vaccine regimen that is safe and effective for all infants, regardless of HIV exposure.||Study Design: Double blinded, randomised, controlled trial. HIV exposed infants will be randomised 1:1 to receive single dose, intradermal MVA85A vaccine or Candin® control at birth. The first 60 infants enrolled in the trial will form a pilot safety cohort for formal Data Monitoring & Ethics Committee (DMEC) safety review. Thereafter, safety and immunogenicity outcomes will be measured in all infants.||Study Population: Infants (n=340) born to HIV infected mothers receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) or Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) prophylaxis.||Sites: Worcester (University of Cape Town) and Khayelitsha (Stellenbosch University), South Africa||Study Intervention: Newborn infants will receive 1 x 108 pfu MVA85A vaccine or Candin® control by intradermal injection. Infants confirmed HIV uninfected by HIV PCR will receive BCG Vaccine SSI at 8 weeks of age. Infants confirmed HIV infected by HIV PCR will not receive BCG.||Primary specific aims:||To evaluate the safety of MVA85A given at birth to HIV exposed uninfected infants.||To evaluate the safety of BCG given at 8 weeks of age to HIV exposed uninfected infants, using an MVA85A prime and BCG boost strategy.||Secondary specific aims:||To evaluate the immunogenicity of MVA85A given at birth to HIV exposed uninfected infants.||To evaluate the immunogenicity of BCG given at 8 weeks of age to HIV exposed uninfected infants, using an MVA85A prime and BCG boost strategy.||Safety endpoints:||Local, regional, and systemic adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs).||Immunology endpoints:||Frequencies of CD4 and CD8 T cells producing any of 4 cytokines (IL-17, IFN-γ, TNF-α, or IL-2), or polyfunctional combinations of these cytokines simultaneously, following stimulation with antigen Ag85A or BCG, measured by whole blood intracellular cytokine assay (WB-ICS).||Specific proliferative capacity of CD8 and CD4 T cells that produce any of the three cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, and/or IL-2) or combinations of these cytokines simultaneously, measured by a novel whole blood 6-day lymphoproliferative flow cytometric assay (WB-prolif).||Relative proportions and absolute numbers of peripheral blood myeloid and lymphoid cell subsets, measured directly ex vivo by flow cytometry.||Study groups: The first 60 infants enrolled in Study Group 1 will undergo intensive safety evaluation, followed by DMEC review of Day-28 safety data. The DMEC will make a formal recommendation on continuation of enrollment and/or changes to the protocol, based on this safety review. Study Groups 2-5 will be evaluated for clinical safety and immunology outcomes.||Statistical Analysis: Cumulative 12-month incidence of local, regional, and systemic AEs, by category, will be compared for HIV exposed uninfected subjects receiving MVA85A vaccine or Candin® control at birth. The sample size has 90% probability of detecting an SAE with a true occurrence rate of 1.5% in infants receiving MVA85A vaccine and 80% power to detect a 15% difference in the rate of non-serious AEs (20% compared to 35%) between the two study arms (p<0.05).

However, the appropriate efavirenz dose during anti-TB treatment remains unclear. Rifampin (an anti-TB drug) increases the activity of the drug metabolizing enzymes that breakdown efavirenz, which may lead to low blood levels of efavirenz and treatment failure during cotreatment. The drug-to-drug interactions between the HIV and anti-TB drugs also vary between individuals based on genetic factors. This study will investigate the effects of anti-TB treatment, as well as drug-gene interactions on the blood concentrations of efavirenz in children with HIV and TB infections.

Despite major efforts to de-centralise services, accessibility to diagnosis is still limited, with one third of the 9 million cases occurring each year being missed by national control programmes.||New TB diagnostics suitable for use at the point-of-care are emerging. Some of these are intended for screening purposes, as an initial step to identify individuals who may have TB and should undergo further tests for confirmation. These tests may have high sensitivity, but also give false-positive results (low specificity). Other tests aim to be the confirmatory tests for TB (high specificity), but these tests are often more expensive and complex and are only available in hospital laboratories. As these tests have different purposes, it is likely they would work better in combination in a step fashion to optimise their impact and to develop an efficient diagnostic process. Furthermore, as none of the tests is versatile enough to be used in all settings, test combinations will need to consider the health system context in which they would be used. Our aim is to develop and evaluate rapid and accurate diagnostic approaches for TB that facilitate the initiation of appropriate treatment on the same day of the initial consultation in Africa.||The objectives are to||Evaluate new diagnostics for TB (including among HIV co-infected individuals) that are suitable at the point-of-care;|Develop diagnostic algorithms that streamline and accelerate the diagnosis of TB, allowing patients to reach clinical management decisions within a single clinic visit;|Determine the impact of using novel point-of-care diagnostic combinations on the proportion of patients correctly initiating TB treatment within 24-48 hours of first attendance; their potential cost effectiveness||The investigators conducted studies in 2016-2018 to accomplish the first two objectives and have identified diagnostic tests that are suitable for low and middle income countries.||This document therefore refers to objective 3, which aims to||Assess the performance of two diagnostic schemes for the diagnosis of TB when compared to culture.|Assess the yield of two diagnostic schemes for the diagnosis of TB when compared to Xpert and|Assess the cost of the two diagnostic schemes compared to Xpert.","Tuberculosis|Hiv","No","Interventional","January 21, 2019","December 31, 2020","CRP and Molbio Truenat MTB|CRP and Xpert ULTRA MTB/RIF|standard test Xpert|Culture as reference standard","Diagnostic Test|Diagnostic Test|Diagnostic Test|Diagnostic Test","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Diagnostic","Parallel Assignment","Nigeria","Randomized","1100",,

3300,"Completed","Background: The disease burden of tuberculosis (TB), second only to HIV/AIDS among infectious diseases, is a major public health problem in developing countries. Accumulating evidence suggests that iron status is a primary determinant of TB progression. Anaemia is prevalent in patients with TB, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, and associated with increased mortality. Anaemia in TB may be due to inflammation, dietary iron deficiency, or both, and distinguishing among these aetiologies is difficult. Iron supplementation is commonly used to treat anaemia in TB patients, but may be unnecessary if inflammation is the cause. Body iron sequestered by TB inflammation can be mobilized during treatment and used to correct the anaemia. Moreover, supplemental iron may be retained within macrophages, potentially increasing susceptibility to TB and leading to a poorer clinical outcome. Thus, better understanding of iron metabolism during TB and the aetiology of TB-related anaemia would clarify the potential role of iron in pathogenesis and optimal management of the disease.||The investigators hypothesize that: a) TB will increase circulating hepcidin and thereby impair dietary iron absorption and systemic utilization of iron, resulting in iron sequestration and anaemia; b) TB treatment and resolution of inflammation over 6 months will decrease circulating hepcidin, correcting these impairments and improving iron status and hemoglobin; c) the majority of iron utilized to replenish hemoglobin during recovery from TB will come from mobilization of sequestered iron stores rather than from iron absorption.||Objectives: Use iron stable isotopes to characterize iron balance over six months of TB treatment, and specifically to: a) quantify oral and intravenous iron incorporation (oral absorption and systemic iron utilization) at three time points during TB treatment (acute disease, after the intensive treatment phase and at completion of the continuation treatment phase); and b) determine the effect of treatment on iron mobilization from stores to replenish hemoglobin.||Methods/Subjects: Using a triple stable-isotope technique, iron absorption from labelled test meals (57Fe) and systemic iron utilization after labelled intravenous doses (54Fe, 58Fe) will be determined in 18 Tanzanian subjects with newly diagnosed pulmonary TB. The subjects will be studied at three time points (i) the day after TB diagnosis while infected, (ii) after 8 weeks of intensive phase treatment, and (iii) after another 16 weeks of continuation phase treatment. Iron status, hemoglobin, hepcidin and inflammation indexes will be measured at each time point. Isotope enrichment during the two treatment phases will be measured to estimate the relative rates of iron absorption and mobilization from stores during the intensive and continuation phases to determine the relative contributions of iron absorption and iron mobilization from stores during TB treatment and recovery.||Outcome: These studies will provide important new insights into the aetiology of anaemia and iron metabolism in TB patients. The results will provide essential data for evidence-based recommendations on the timing, administration route and efficacy of iron therapy in patients with TB, making possible, a safer and more effective treatment of anaemia in TB while decreasing morbidity and mortality from the disease.","Tuberculosis","No","Observational","April 2015","January 2017","Stable iron isotopes, non-drug intervention","Other",,"All","45 Years","18 Years",,,"Tanzania",,"19",,

Thus in low and middle income countries, most drug sensitivity testing relies on phenotypic drug resistance testing, which takes up to 4 months. In addition, currently, culture on monthly sputum samples is recommended by the World Health Organization for follow-up of Rifampicin Resistant Tuberculosis patients under treatment. Unfortunately, culture is often not locally available and samples need to be transported from field to culture laboratories. The associated transport delays lead to high rates of contamination and false negative culture, particularly in laboratories in low resource settings.

3306,"Unknown status","- Background and study aims?||Some of the drugs used to treat HIV (anti-retrovirals, or ARVs) can affect the blood levels of other drugs used to treat TB - called a ""drug-drug interaction"". The main drug used in second-line therapy, Aluvia (lopinavir/ritonavir), is one of the drugs that has this effect. This is why people on second-line ARVs usually cannot use one of the main TB drugs, ""rifampicin"", and instead will be prescribed a slightly different drug called ""rifabutin"", which is less affected by these drug-drug interactions. Although blood levels of rifabutin are not as badly affected by Aluvia as blood levels of rifampicin, rifabutin levels in the blood are still increased a lot by taking Aluvia at the same time. This could lead to higher levels of side-effects because there is more drug in the body. So in the past doctors have suggested that instead of taking rifabutin every day with Aluvia, it should only be taken three times a week, on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. However, in the last 2 years, new studies have suggested that this three times a week regimen might not be enough and that it may not completely cure TB. So the purpose of this study is to find out whether taking rifabutin every day with Aluvia really does lead to more side-effects, and whether taking rifabutin three times a week with Aluvia really does lead to much lower levels of rifabutin in the blood.||- Who can participate?||This substudy is specifically for people who are already taking anti-TB drugs in EARNEST, or who need to start anti-TB drugs whilst they are in the EARNEST trial.||- What does the study involve?||Participants will be selected (by chance, chosen by a computer) to one of the following two rifabutin groups:||Group 1: Rifabutin (150 mg) taken three times a week on Monday/Wednesday/Friday Group 2: Rifabutin (150 mg) taken every day On these days, one capsule of rifabutin (150 mg) should be taken in the morning by mouth.||Participants will be asked to attend clinic 2 and 12 weeks after entering the sub-study then every 6 weeks until the end of their TB treatment, and then return to their usual EARNEST follow-up schedule. This is roughly the same visit schedule for people with TB who are usually seen more frequently than those without TB, whether or not the patients join this sub-study. The 2 week visit is specifically so the investigators can make sure participants are doing OK on rifabutin and to check carefully that they don't have any side-effects. At all these visits (including the day when participants enroll into the substudy) the investigators will take an extra 10 ml (two teaspoons) of blood to do laboratory tests for side-effects of rifabutin, and to measure the levels of rifabutin and other ARVs in the blood - these are called ""pharmacokinetic"" or ""PK"" studies. On the day of these visits, participants should not take their dose of rifabutin until after this blood draw, so the investigators can measure the lowest amount of drug likely in their blood. Instead, participants should bring the rifabutin dose to clinic, so that they can take it straight after the blood draw. At the visit 12 weeks after starting rifabutin, participants will need to stay in clinic for a second blood draw of ~3 ml (half a teaspoon) around 4 hours after they take the rifabutin dose immediately after the first blood draw. We use this second sample to see how quickly rifabutin enters the blood. At this special visit the investigators will make sure participants are first seen as early as possible, so they don't have to stay any longer than necessary for the second blood draw to be taken 4 hours later. After participants have completed their TB treatment they will stay in EARNEST until the end of the trial (144 weeks on second-line therapy).||- What are the possible benefits and risks of participating?||If participants are allocated to Group 1 (150 mg rifabutin three times a week), there is a risk that they may have lower levels of rifabutin in your blood and this may be less effective at treating the TB. However, participants should have fewer side-effects. In contrast, if participants are allocated to Group 2 (150 mg rifabutin daily), here is a risk that they may get more side-effects, but the levels of rifabutin in the blood should be more than high enough to have a good chance of curing the TB. Having blood taken may cause some discomfort and/or bruising in some people. It is currently impossible to know which rifabutin regimen would be best and participants may find in years to come that they may or may not have received the best treatment.||Where is the study run from?||9 EARNEST sites in Uganda as follows: JCRC Kampala, IDI, San Raphael of St Francis Hospital (Nsambya), JCRC Mbarara, JCRC Mbale, JCRC Kabale, JCRC Kakira, JCRC Gulu||When is study starting and how long is it expected to run?||Start 05/03/2012 finish on 31/01/2014||- Who is funding the study?

The difference in what the investigators know works and what is actually delivered at the clinic-level to patients, is known as the ""science-to-service gap."" In the realm of tuberculosis (TB) prevention, this gap is reflected in <20% of TB preventive therapy (TPT) -eligible persons living with HIV (PWH) being offered or initiated on isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in many settings. Recent innovation in TPT have brought new pharmacological options allowing for shorter courses, intermittent dosing, or both.||The overarching goal of this study is to identify a generalizable approach to overcome current barriers to delivery of TPT in order to achieve high levels of TPT delivery during routine care in public clinics. Multiple approaches are in standard use to change prescribing behavior including in service training, audit and feedback, clinical mentoring, the use of clinical decision aids, and ""academic detailing."" However, the overall change is generally modest. To achieve a substantial increase in TPT delivery (from current approximately 20% to 60-80%) will require a fundamental change in the approach to selecting patients for TPT - a redesign of the choice architecture of TPT prescribing.||Methods: The investigators are proposing a choice architecture that makes prescribing TPT the ""default"" or standard option and that for TPT not to be prescribed will require a choice by a clinician to ""opt-out"" of TPT for a specific patient.||The investigators are proposing a cluster randomized design to test the choice architecture approach to increasing delivery of TPT. Clinics will be randomized to one of two strategies: (1) standard implementation and (2) choice architecture default TPT. Because of the clinic-level nature of the implementation strategies, all PWH receiving care at a clinic will be exposed to the standard implementation or TPT routinization implementation. Clinical process data will be used to assess the effectiveness of each strategy to determine the proportion of PWH (1) screened for TPT, (2) eligible for TPT, and (3) prescribed TPT.||Significance: TB is the leading cause of death among PWH in South Africa and elsewhere on the continent. TPT is a proven intervention to reduce mortality among PWH but is not widely prescribed. This study seeks to identify an implementation strategy to reach optimal TPT prescribing.","HIV/AIDS|Tuberculosis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","September 15, 2021","December 31, 2023","Choice Architecture","Behavioral","Not Applicable","All",,"18 Years","Health Services Research","Parallel Assignment","South Africa","Randomized","36",,

There are many reasons for this, among which are diagnostic difficulties, extended treatments, drug resistance and health care provision. This application is concerned with all these drivers and will focus activities on a clinic which provides basic care in a very deprived socio-economic area of greater Cape Town, South Africa.||Patients studied in routine, but demanding environments are our focus as these clinics are representative of many areas where TB (and HIV) are found at high prevalence.

The investigators wish to maximise this opportunity by collecting biological samples from a patient population experiencing a TB epidemic for the evaluation of future TB diagnostics.||Using human DNA, the investigators will attempt to determine reasons for poor or no treatment response. Two possibilities exist for this: a) the M. tuberculosis strain is resistant to the drug in question or b) the patient is highly susceptible to the bacterium. The investigators will determine the exome sequences of study participants with susceptible M. tuberculosis strains who show poor or no response, and compare this with rapid responders. Using 16S rRNA sequencing, the investigators will also observe how the microbiome of TB patients is altered during TB treatment and how this is associated with treatment outcome, as well as after TB treatment.||This project will set the foundation for the implementation of new POC TB diagnostic technologies in clinics in South Africa.

The incidence of MDR-TB worldwide is 3.9% for new cases and 21% for previously treated cases. However, the incidence of previously treated cases can rise to above 50% in eastern European countries. With increasing frequency of MDR-TB (and even extensively drug-resistant types), morbidity and mortality due to TB fail to decline worldwide. Amikacin, one of the drugs against MDR-TB, has the most potent effect when reaching a high peak serum concentration and this means that high doses have to be administered. Treatment with amikacin by inhalation would be a tremendous advantage due to the high local dose in the lungs, obtaining high local levels without the possible toxicity due to high serum levels. With the currently available inhalation techniques these local levels cannot be reached easily.||In this protocol, the investigators will perform a pharmacokinetic and local tolerability study of dry powder amikacin using the Cyclops™ in patients with drug susceptible tuberculosis.||Objective:||primary objective is to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of dry powder amikacin at different dosages and compare the peak serum values to a single i.v. dose.|secondary objective is to assess the local tolerability of dry powder amikacin via the Cyclops™ at different dosages.||Study design: single center, active control, ascending dose response study Study population: 8 patients with DSTB.

And in the light of what has already been practiced for other molecules such as mycophenolate for example which is carried AUC or miniAUC for example. It would therefore be in the achievement of AUC in all patients treated with LNZ for TB MDR / XDR for over a week.

The proposed study (Study 31 PK/PD) will examine the population pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) of high-dose daily rifapentine with and without moxifloxacin given for 17 weeks. Two different PK sampling procedures are required for the population PK/PD assessments involving rifapentine and moxifloxacin: (1) intensive sampling of 6 samples/participant on one occasion plus subsequent sparse sampling for a subset of Study 31 participants who are invited to co-enroll in Study 31 PK/PD; and (2) sparse sampling of 2-3 samples/participant for all other Study 31 trial participants (these data will be collected as part of the Study 31 treatment protocol). Herein, we describe the PK sampling to be conducted among those Study 31 participants who are co-enrolled to Study 31 PK/PD (n=60). Intensive PK sampling is needed in some participants to estimate the population PK model parameters with no bias and satisfactory precision (relative standard error < 20%). PK and outcomes data from all participants in Study 31 will be merged to build the population PK/PD models to evaluate PK/PD parameters. Details regarding these planned analyses are also provided in this Study 31 PK/PD protocol.||Primary Objectives:||Characterize the population pharmacokinetics of rifapentine and 25-desacetyl rifapentine, using sparse PK data from Study 31 and intensive PK data from Study 31 PK/PD. Using the population PK model, determine post-hoc Bayesian estimates of individual-level PK parameters.||Examine the relationship between rifapentine PK parameters of interest and treatment efficacy. PK parameters will include area under the concentration time curve (AUC0-24), peak concentration (Cmax), time above the mean inhibitory concentration (MIC), and AUC/MIC. The treatment outcome of interest will be time to culture conversion and time to treatment failure or relapse.||Secondary Objectives:||Among the Study 31 participants in the lowest 10% for rifapentine AUC0-24, examine the PK/PD effect on culture conversion of sputa after completion of 4 months of daily rifapentine therapy.|Examine the relationship between safety outcomes (Grade 3 or higher adverse events) and rifapentine PK parameters (AUC0-24, Cmax, AUC0-24/MIC and time above MIC).|Characterize the population PK of moxifloxacin, and then estimate moxifloxacin AUC0-24 and Cmax when moxifloxacin is administered with rifapentine given at a daily dose of 1200 mg.|Examine the relationships between moxifloxacin PK and treatment outcomes (as described in objective 2 for rifapentine) and moxifloxacin PK and safety (as described in objective 4 for rifapentine).||Design:||In Study 31 PK/PD, among 60 participants with tuberculosis enrolled in a rifapentine-based treatment arm of Study 31, PK data will be collected on two occasions. At TBTC sites that have the capacity to perform this activity, participants will have 6 scheduled PK samples per participant collected to measure rifapentine (with or without moxifloxacin) concentrations over approximately 24 hours.

3418,"Completed","Typhoid fever remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the developing world. It is estimated that more than 16 million cases and about 600,000 deaths occur annually, most of which occur in Southeast Asia and Africa. Ingestion of food or water contaminated by acutely infected persons or chronic carriers is the most common form of transmission. As a result, typhoid fever is prevalent where unsafe drinking water or contaminated food is common.||Typhoid fever is highly endemic in Vietnam, especially in the southern provinces and is a significant disease in both preschool and school-aged children. Data from Dong Thap Provincial Hospital, Mekong delta region showed that among 3,934 hospitalized typhoid fever cases from 1990 to 1995, 4.2% had complications and 0.8% died.||Typhoid fever has become difficult and expensive to treat. About 90% of Salmonella typhi isolates are of multidrug-resistant (resistant to chloramphenicol, ampicillin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and 76% of isolates showed reduced susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. Isolates with full fluoroquinolone or extended spectrum cephalosporin resistance have not yet reported in Vietnam but occur sporadically in the Indian subcontinent.

Salmonella typhi, the bacteria causing typhoid fever, have become resistant to several antibiotics increasing the difficulty of treating the disease. The disease may have serious complications effecting bones, brain, and intestines, with permanent injury or death. Methods to control typhoid fever, such as a sanitary water and food supply, along with effective sewage treatment, are not likely to be available soon in those countries.||NIH scientists developed a vaccine called Vi, made of a polysaccharide (a chain of linked sugars) from the surface of Salmonella typhi, the bacteria that cause typhoid fever. It has been approved by the World Health Organization and is licensed in 94 countries. It is effective in adults but not in young children. Clinical trials have shown that chemically binding the Vi to a protein to form a ""conjugate vaccine"" has improved and extended its efficacy to children (conjugate vaccines to other bacteria, notably meningitis causing bacteria have been used extensively and successfully). Now NIH scientists have developed another vaccine for typhoid fever - using a polysaccharide from fruit, known as pectin. The pectin has been chemically treated so that it resembles Vi. The treated pectin, O-acetyl pectin, is bound to a protein; exoprotein A, (rEPA). The result is a conjugate, as was formed for Vi. Similarly to the Vi conjugate it induces antibodies against Salmonella typhi in laboratory animals. If the O-acetyl pectin conjugate proves successful, it will be evaluated in children ages 5 to 14 years old and in infants, toward using it with routine vaccines for infants.||Volunteers ages 18 to 45 who do not have an allergy to fruit pectin and who have not been vaccinated against nor had typhoid fever within the last 5 years may be eligible for this study.||Volunteers will undergo several tests at their first visit to the clinic for this study. A blood sample (about 2/3 of an ounce) will be taken to test for HIV, hepatitis B and C, complete blood count, liver functions, blood chemistry and pregnancy in women of childbearing age.

Namibia is a high TB burden country with an incidence rate of 446/100,000 in 2016; about 11,000 new cases per year. 3.9% of new cases and 8.7% of previously treated cases have MDR-TB. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has recently been applied to interrogate the complete genetic code of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strains. WGS can be used to infer relationships between identified strains as well as determine genomic variations involved in resistance development.||The specific aims of the H3TB study are to: (i) characterise the DR-TB epidemic, in terms of clinical, epidemiological, geospatial, social network and laboratory data, to identify transmission hotspots in three regions of Namibia, (ii) evaluate the feasibility of targeted case finding intervention strategies to improve DR-TB control in highly affected populations and (iii) develop a transmission model to investigate the potential impact of the case finding intervention strategies on DR-TB incidence in Namibia.||A prospective surveillance study started in January 2020, which includes all DR-TB cases in Namibia, and which will nest H3TB. Data collection tools and other study implementation tools have been designed and implemented. The study team is working in close collaboration with the National Institute of Pathology, where all DR-TB cases from the country are registered, to ensure all possible cases are captured. This is important for the identification of transmission hotspots.||After HREC and MOHSS approval, individuals with GeneXpert® MTB/RIF rifampicin-resistant samples and a positive Mtb culture from three regions in Namibia will be included in a transmission hotspot identification study. Preliminary data have shown that DR-TB clusters exist in these regions. Clinical, epidemiological, geospatial, social network and laboratory data (GeneXpert® MTB/RIF, culture, drug sensitivity tests) will be collected. WGS capacity has been established at the UNAM research laboratory, where WGS will be performed on the samples of H3TB participants; results will be validated at the Research Center Borstel in Germany.

Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) is resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid, and extensively drug-resistant TB is additional resistance to a fluoroquinolone and a second injectable line drug. Methods currently employed in testing for resistance are inadequate and a contributing factor to the 40-50% MDR-TB treatment success rate. Current drug susceptibility testing methods are slow for most drugs, taking weeks. Rapid molecular methods such as the line probe assays, e.g. Hain GenoType MDRTBplus and sl, provide resistant calls to only a limited number of drugs, and are often less useful in smear negative patients.||Molecular technologies such as sequencing can provide a comprehensive readout of drug resistance and are able to detect resistant populations at very low levels (≤1%), thus enabling individualized therapy. This can be done directly from sputum. Targeted sequencing amplifies regions of genomic DNA associated with resistance prior to sequencing.

The difference in what investigators know works and what is actually delivered at the clinic-level to patients, is known as the ""science-to-service gap."" In the realm of tuberculosis (TB) prevention, this gap is reflected in <20% of TB preventive therapy (TPT)-eligible persons living with HIV (PLWH) being offered or initiated on isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) in many settings. Recent innovation in TPT have brought new pharmacological options allowing for shorter courses, intermittent dosing, or both. A 12-dose once-weekly rifapentine and isoniazid (3HP) regimen has been demonstrated to be effective and well tolerated. This regimen has several potential advantages over IPT; however, if patients are never assessed for 3HP eligibility and 3HP is not prescribed, TPT packets will remain on pharmacy shelves and the potential health benefits will not reach those who need it.||The overarching goal of this study is to identify a generalizable approach to overcome current barriers to delivery of TPT in order to achieve high levels of TPT delivery during routine care in public clinics. Investigators are proposing a choice architecture that makes prescribing TPT the ""default"" or standard option and that for TPT not to be prescribed will require a choice by a clinician to ""opt-out"" of TPT for a specific patient.||Methods: Investigators will use a cluster randomized design with the larger IMPAACT4TB (I4TB) program to deliver 3HP to countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A subset of countries and clinics within these I4TB countries will be included with each clinic the unit of randomization. Clinics within study countries will be randomized to one of two strategies: (1) standard implementation within the UNITAID project (clinic training on TPT along with posters and other standard medication material) and (2) choice architecture default TPT.||Clinical process data will be used to assess the effectiveness of each strategy to determine the proportion of PLWH (1) screened for TB preventive therapy, (2) eligible for TPT, and (3) prescribed TPT.||Significance: Identifying a pragmatic approach will lead the way for improving TPT prescribing across the study sites.

Although the aim of this policy is to find previously undetected TB patients and reduce transmission, such investigations represent a missed opportunity to start contacts without TB on preventive therapy (TPT). The WHO guidelines do not address the optimal implementation of contact investigation. The standard of care (SOC) in most settings, passive referral of pediatric contacts to the clinic by the index TB patient, has largely remained unsuccessful in practice. In 2017, the WHO estimated only 23% of eligible child contacts were started on TB preventive therapy. Household contact investigation has been shown to have a higher yield in active TB case finding, but is labor intensive, and may be challenging to implement in densely populated urban settings or informal settlements/slums. The WHO recently endorsed the use of a new TPT regimen (rifapentine and isoniazid weekly (3HP)) for both children and adults in high burden settings, and the programmatic roll out of this regimen offers the opportunity to simultaneously examine new strategies to improve the identification and treatment of pediatric TB household contacts.||Objective: To compare the effectiveness of community-based versus facility-based child contact investigation and delivery of TB preventive care to inform the optimal implementation strategy for investigating pediatric household TB contacts.||Study Design: Cluster-randomized trial in 32 clinics (16 clinics per arm) divided equally among South Africa and Ethiopia (8 clinics per arm per country).||Methods: Newly diagnosed qualifying TB index patients (determined by South African or Ethiopian National TB guidelines) and participants' household child contacts will be recruited to participate. Local staff, including the relevant nurses and community health workers in the intervention and control clinics, will be trained to conduct contact investigation with a symptom-based approach for all child contacts under 15 years old in home and at the clinic. Data will be collected using routine medical files and then retrospectively abstracted by the research team. Thirty-two primary health clinics will be stratified (by TB case notification and by country) and randomized in 1:1 fashion to either community-based or facility-based delivery of care. Household child contacts under 15 years of age who screen negative for TB disease will be initiated on TPT by a healthcare worker (nurse, community health worker, etc.) either in the home or clinic setting. Children in the intervention arm who screen positive will first be sent to the nurse at the clinic for repeat screening. Children who have a persistently positive screen in the intervention arm and those with a positive screen in the control arm using South Africa's or Ethiopia's pediatric symptom screening tool will be referred to a physician at the district hospital for further investigation of TB disease, as is the standard of care in both settings.

The selection of processing methods was based on accuracy results, degree of simplification allowing their introduction at PHC level, and finding from the TB-Speed in-vitro stool processing study.

Despite the availability of highly effective and accessible medications in the developing world where TB is endemic, the 6-18 month treatment regimen is often thwarted as patients fail to comply due to a lack of knowledge about the disease, desire for privacy, and/or stigma avoidance. Successful TB treatment is critical for reducing transmission, the selection of drug-resistant strains and treatment costs. Mobile health interventions promise to increase treatment success, especially in regions where directly observed treatment (DOT) is impractical. The most promising interventions attempted thus far employ a combination of SMS reminders and medication monitors. However, there is relatively little high-quality evidence on their impact, and what evidence there is shows mixed success.||In Kenya, the burden of TB is among the highest in the world with a prevalence rate of 558 cases per 100,000 people.

Therefore, it is vital to find these missing cases and promptly link them to care to reduce disease progression and interrupt further transmission.

In partnership with KHANA, the National Center for Tuberculosis and Leprosy Control (CENAT), and the Cambodia Anti-Tuberculosis Association (CATA), we will conduct a pragmatic cluster randomized controlled trial comparing 1) the ACF with the seed-and-recruit model; 2) ACF targeting household and neighborhood contacts; 3) ACF targeting the older population using mobile screening units; and 4) passive case finding (PCF) approach. The primary outcome will be the case notification rate in the intervention and control districts during the study period. We will also determine additionality, comparing the yield in each arm with its respective historical baseline and the cumulative yield over the implementation period. The secondary outcomes include the number needed to screen to detect one TB case, cost-effectiveness (direct and indirect costs per TB case notified), and the treatment outcome of all people with TB in this study.

The Uganda national target of utilizing the DOTS (Direct Observed Treatment Short Course) to successfully treat 85% of patients diagnosed with TB has not been met. Currently, the country only detects 49.6% TB case detection, of which it successfully treats 73%. The DOTS strategy has suffered many socioeconomic challenges, which have resulted into its abandonment by many of the Ugandan hospitals. Poor TB medication adherence greatly attribute to the many cases of TB in Uganda. Causes of non-adherence to TB medication include lack of patient follow-up, patients' lack of transport to go to the clinics to pick up drugs, patients' forgetfulness. There is evidence that real time adherence monitoring linked with SMS reminders and social support notifications can address barriers to sustained ART (antiretroviral therapy) adherence. Such novel interventions addressing TB medication adherence challenges in low resource settings to date are limited.

Eight matched prison pairs will be randomly selected for this study in which eight prisons from each pair will be randomly assigned to the intervention and the remaining to the control group. Trained prison peer educators at the intervention sites will organize and provide education about TB every two weeks on a regular basis for one year. Peer educators will also perform routine TB screening, using a screening protocol to identify presumptive TB cases for a referral. Identified presumptive TB cases will then be linked to the prison health personnel for a referral to nearby hospitals. The TB diagnosis will be carried out at the referral sites using the routine direct smear microscopy and/or chest X-ray (Radiography). Tuberculosis case finding in the control sites will follow the existing referral system (self-referral to nearby hospitals) and the diagnosis will be undertaken using direct sputum microscopy and/or chest X-ray as in the intervention sites. The data will be entered using Epi Data entry version 3.1 software and analyzed using SPSS version 20.0.

Treatment outcomes are poor, driven by toxicity and limited efficacy of the 2nd-line anti-TB drugs.||Although there is evidence that both anti-TB activity and most of the toxicity of the key drugs are related to drug exposure, the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships in patients with MDR-TB are poorly characterized. Moreover potential synergy of drug combinations has not been identified in the context of MDR-TB, dosing has not taken into account the concentrations needed to suppress resistance, and the role of minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in dosing is poorly studied.||There are therefore opportunities to optimize drug doses and combinations to improve efficacy, and reduce toxicity.

Prior studies have proven the role of ibuprofen (an NSAID) in modulating lung injury and decreasing pulmonary damage in cystic fibrosis. While there has been an intense effort by the scientific community to define the best treatment strategies for tuberculosis immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS), to our knowledge there is no available study evaluating preventive strategies using anti-inflammatory agents for TB-IRIS, a highly morbid complication in HIV-infected TB patients initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART).||Design and Methods: We propose to conduct a single center double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial to investigate the efficacy of daily self-administered Meloxicam (a NSAID) versus placebo for prevention of Tuberculosis associated Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (TB-IRIS). A total of 150 HIV-infected adults who are treated for Tuberculosis for at least 2 weeks and about to initiate HIV treatment at Brewelskloof Hospital, Worcester, and Tygerberg Teaching Hospital, Cape Town, will be randomized to one of the following treatments: Meloxicam 7.5 mg tablet once-a-day, the experimental arm, versus Placebo tablet once-a-day, the control arm, for 8 weeks. All patients will be followed up for 12 months. Primary efficacy outcome: The decrease of the incidence of paradoxical TB IRIS by at least 20%; Primary safety outcome: The proportion of patients who temporarily or permanently discontinue Meloxicam due to any adverse event (e.g. dyspepsia or gastro-intestinal upset). Secondary outcomes are: 1) the proportion of patients in each arm with the following indicators of TB-IRIS severity/quality of life (QOL) (degree of pain or discomfort >III, presence of local or disseminated suppuration/abscess of any site, unscheduled clinic visits, hospitalizations, missed more than a day at work, etc; 2) The incidence of other types of IRIS (e.g. Kaposi Sarcoma or cryptococcal meningitis).||This study will provide important and novel data on the feasibility and efficacy of using a cheap, widely available NSAID used in both developed and developing countries, as a preventive intervention for TB-IRIS that could be quickly put into practice if proven to be effective","Tuberculosis","No","Interventional","April 2014","April 2015","Meloxicam 7.5mg daily for 8 weeks","Drug","Phase 3","All",,"18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","South Africa","Randomized","200",,

Few studies to date have examined the use of knowledge translation strategies to improve health care outcomes in low income countries. However, given that the majority of health care in these settings is provided by workers with less training and limited resources, the theoretical potential for knowledge translation strategies to improve health care delivery and outcomes by integrating best evidence into routine practice may be greatest in these settings.||Knowledge translation (KT) is an approach to changing health care provider behavior to reduce the gap between evidence and practice in health care delivery. There has been a tendency for knowledge translation interventions to employ generic, ""off the shelf"", strategies, and apply them to deal with specific issues. This generic approach, fails to recognize the variability in the specific characteristics of health care settings, in terms of their patient populations, health care systems, and health care providers. These characteristics, whether they function as barriers or facilitators to change, make a generalized approach to KT ineffective, where a tailored strategy, which specifically adjusts its approach to measured local barriers and facilitators may achieve better alignment of practice to evidence. This is likely to be particularly true in low income countries where the majority of health care is provided by non-physician health care workers, working within a wider range of health care systems, with variable and unique patient populations and resource constraints. Given the potential to significantly impact health care outcomes at relatively low cost, further research is needed both to develop methods for identifying potential barriers and facilitators to KT strategies in specific resource poor settings, and to evaluate the effectiveness of KT strategies tailored to address the identified barriers.||This study will assess the effectiveness of a two part knowledge translation intervention tailored to address factors identified in a previous study as functioning as barriers and facilitators to treatment adherence among patients on treatment for tuberculosis or combined tuberculosis and antiretroviral treatment, targeting improved patient adherence and health outcomes, in a specific low income country.","Tuberculosis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","March 2011","May 2012","Knowledge translation intervention|Palm-Plus","Other|Other","Not Applicable","All",,,"Health Services Research","Parallel Assignment","Malawi","Randomized","28",,

3696,"Completed","S. pneumoniae is frequently isolated from nasal swabs of healthy subjects, but it can also cause severe diseases (pneumonia, bacteraemia, meningitis and sepsis).HIV-infected subjects are more sensitive to invasive diseases and recurrent infection than the general population. Nasal carriage is the main pathogenetic feature for invasive disease: bacteraemia is more frequent in carriers, HIV+ patients are constantly colonized by the same pneumococcal strain and their nasopharyngeal isolates have features similar to subsequent invasive strains. A 23-valent polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23) has long been available and recommended in the HIV+ population as prophylaxis for invasive disease. Studies regarding efficacy of PPV23 in HIV+ are controversial and highlight that immune response induced by PPV23 in HIV+ is poor and an hyporesponsiveness to repeated polysaccaridic antigens stimulation can occur. Moreover, PPV23 seems not to affect pneumococcal carriage status and could lead to emergence of non-vaccine serotypes. The conjugation of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides to carrier proteins results in an improved T-cell dependent immune response, characterized by increased antibody concentrations and induction of T and B memory cells, with a demonstrated higher efficacy in children. A heptavalent vaccine conjugated with diphtheria toxoid (PCV7) is approved in Europe since 2001 and is effective in reducing incidence of invasive disease by vaccine serotypes (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F), in both children and adults, due to effect of herd immunity. A PCV13 formulation has recently been developed, covering PCV7 serotypes plus 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F and 19A. PCV13 revealed the same safety profile as PCV7 in pediatric patients, that are the main target of conjugate vaccines licensure. Some trials showed a better antibody response in terms of quantity and quality in HIV + adults by using PCV7 as compared to PPV23. However these data were not unequivocally confirmed in further studies on the use of PCV7 alone or in combination with PPV23. The first trials of PCV13 use in adults showed the same or even better response compared to PPV23, with a safety and tolerability similar to PCV7. PCV13 in HIV+ adults is a promising candidate prophylactic measure for pneumococcal infections.

However, recent evidence suggests that during prophylactic therapy the body is exposed to antibiotic levels capable of increasing antibiotic resistance and bacterial virulence.

3704,"Unknown status","In post-menopausal women, the condition atrophic vaginitis results from the loss of oestrogen and is characterised by dyspareunia (pain during intercourse), vaginal dryness, and vaginal irritation. It is often diagnosed alongside recurrent urinary tract infections (rUTIs) and may increase susceptibility to rUTI. Topical vaginal oestrogen can be used to re-condition the vaginal epithelium and also reduces the incidence of rUTIs. However, patients often express concerns about using oestrogen, a hormonal treatment. Studies also report side-effects including vaginal bleeding, discharge, burning and itching that underpin significant (28%) drop-out rates. Hence, alternative non-hormonal, non-antibiotic based therapies that treat the vaginal atrophy, but also reduce the incidence of rUTI are needed.||Recurrent UTI in adult women is common. Bacteria from the gut can colonise the vulvar epithelia and then the bladder, causing uncomfortable urinary symptoms (cystitis). The lifetime risk of a UTI is around 40% in adult women which increases in post-menopausal women. Annually, UTI incidence is 3%. Of those affected, 5% will suffer rUTI, rising to 13% in the over 60 population. This equates to over 300,000 of the adult female UK population annually affected by rUTI. The most frequent treatment for rUTIs is low dose antibiotics, but this treatment causes the bacteria carried by such women to become antibiotic resistant, which exacerbates the clinical problem. The prevalence of antimicrobial multi-resistance within post-menopausal women suffering from rUTI is around 25% and was shown to rise to more than 80% following prolonged antibiotics. These data support the use of non-antibiotic treatment strategies that prevent rUTI and the emergence of drug resistant micro-organisms.||This study will compare two groups with differing treatment strategies.

There have been major advances in understanding the mechanism of disease together with improved diagnosis and management. The aim of the proposed studies is to identify markers predictive of a rapid response to antibiotic treatment and to investigate the pathogenesis of paradoxical reactions and oedematous lesions in Mu disease.||Infection with Mu results in a nodule under the skin which enlarges and breaks down to form an ulcer. This is because Mu produces a toxin that spreads outwards and damages subcutaneous tissue.

This is unpleasant and it would be better if the treatment could be shortened. Our previous studies suggest this may be possible. Therefore a wide range of tests will be investigated in order to identify markers for people in whom the infection is at an early stage with low numbers of Mu bacteria and low levels of toxin in the skin. During antibiotic treatment the rate of healing will be measured to find out which markers are the most reliable.||In some patients new areas of inflammation develop despite treatment and this is called a paradoxical reaction. The immune response to Mu will be investigated serially during antibiotic treatment to investigate the cause of paradoxical reactions.||About 15% of patients have oedematous disease, the most severe form of Buruli ulcer.

The Duke Criteria are recommended for evaluation of probability of presence of infective endocarditis by current ESC guidelines. However, since the introduction of Duke criteria in 1994, characteristics of patients presenting with potential infective endocarditis have substantially changed, especially in tertiary care facilities, towards a high proportion of patients with immune deficiency (caused by illness or medically induced), critically ill patients, patients with prosthetic valves and patients with long-lasting intensive care treatment. Likewise, with the increasing interventional therapy of structural heart disease and device implantation in older and multi-morbid patient cohorts, the frequency of endocarditis on prosthetic material and devices increased over the last decades. While Duke criteria overall misclassify a substantial proportion of patients with endocarditis, Duke criteria are difficult to apply in these patients because of lower sensitivity. Therefore, several modifications of the Duke criteria have been proposed.

Antibiotic resistance is not only a concern for the patient who receives antibiotics, but also for neighbouring patients in the ICU, as well as future patients in the ICU and the hospital at large - through patient-to-patient transmission, and environmental contamination.||No previous randomized controlled trials have directly compared shorter versus longer durations of antimicrobial treatment in these patients. The investigators will conduct a multi-center randomized concealed allocation trial of shorter duration (7 days) versus longer duration (14 days) antibiotic treatment for critically ill patients with bacteremia admitted to ICU. Eligible, patients will be randomized to either 7 days or 14 days of adequate antimicrobial treatment. The selection of type, dose and route of antibiotics will be at the discretion of the treating physicians, but the duration of treatment (7 versus 14 days) will be determined by randomization group. The randomization assignment will not be communicated to the study research coordinator, study critical care or infectious diseases investigators or clinicians until day 8. The primary outcome for the main trial will be 90-day mortality.||The study will be initiated at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre in Toronto, Ontario, and then rolled out to a second site at Kingston General Hospital in Kingston, Ontario. These sites will be sufficient to meet the sample size goals for the pilot RCT, but if additional funds are obtained the investigators will also roll out to the other Canadian ICUs listed below.

In addition, at least four blood cultures in 24 hours were taken for 10 to 20% of patients. The practice of a single blood culture reduces the sensitivity of the analysis due to insufficient total amount of blood collected.

NIDIAG aims to develop an improved, patient-centred system for delivering primary health care in resource-constrained settings. NIDIAG will investigate three clinical syndromes, namely (i) persistent digestive disorders, (ii) persistent fever and (iii) neurological disorders, due to neglected tropical diseases (NTDs). The current study focuses on persistent digestive disorders, which are defined as diarrhoea or abdominal pain that last for at least 2 weeks.||While acute diarrhoea has been studied globally, few research activities have focused on the epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of long-lasting diarrhoeal episodes (2 weeks and longer) in the tropics. The spectrum of possibly involved pathogens includes more than 30 bacterial, parasitic and viral infectious agents. This lack of data may be explained by the fact that people suffering from NTDs might only seek care at a late stage of the disease. Furthermore, health systems in affected regions are often weak and their primary health-care centres are often under-staffed and lack essential diagnostic equipment.||The hypothesis of this study is that development of an evidence-based syndromic approach can lead to better diagnosis and management of NTDs in patients with persistent digestive disorders. The study will be carried out in two West African countries (Côte d'Ivoire and Mali) and in two Asian countries (Indonesia and Nepal). The study will follow a ""case-control"" design and patients and controls will be prospectively enrolled. In order to address the knowledge gaps, three specific objectives will be pursued. First, the contribution of NTDs to the 'persistent digestive disorders syndrome' will be assessed. Second, the value of clinical features and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for the diagnosis of target NTDs that give rise to persistent digestive disorders will be determined. Third, the clinical response to standard empiric and targeted treatment of several NTDs in patients with persistent digestive disorders will be evaluated. These objectives will provide a long-term benefit for the communities by improving the clinical decision-making process for the target NTDs and thus, better diagnostic work-up and patient management can be achieved in the study countries and other similar resource-constrained countries","Soil-transmitted Helminthiasis|Schistosomiasis|Strongyloidiasis|Shigellosis|Intestinal Salmonellosis|Campylobacteriosis|Aeromonas Spp. Infections|Giardiasis|Amoebiasis|Dientamoebiasis|Cryptosporidium Spp. Infections","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","July 2014","May 2016","Stool culturing for pathogenic bacteria|Kato-Katz technique|Baermann technique|Mini-FLOTAC|Crypto/Giardia Duo Strip|Formalin-ether concentration technique|CCA RDT|Koga agar plate culture|Kinyoun staining|Multiplex PCR|Metagenomics analysis","Procedure|Procedure|Procedure|Device|Device|Procedure|Device|Procedure|Procedure|Device|Procedure",,"All",,"1 Year",,,"Côte D'Ivoire|Indonesia|Indonesia|Mali|Mali|Nepal|Nepal",,"2800",,

In 1990s we evaluated the use of community-wide treatment with oral azithromycin in a project called Azithromycin in Control of Trachoma (ACT). This approach resulted in clinical improvement and dramatic reduction in prevalence of chlamydial infection through a 1-year follow-up. We enrolled the ACT villages, as well as an additional village that had not had any prior treatments, in our ACT II (2005) study and performed clinical surveys to assess trachoma activity testing conjunctival swabs for the presence of C. trachomatis by nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Thus, we hoped to determine the long-term (10 year) effects of azithromycin treatment.||We have completed the census and clinical survey of the initial three villages. Mass treatment with azithromycin would not be justified with such low rates (1.8 - 4%) of ocular chlamydial infection. We have treated only those living in households with one or more cases of chlamydial infection and we will not follow up on these individually treated families.||In order to achieve the goals of our study, we now propose to identify other more remote villages with trachoma infection rates of 20% or more to evaluate the effect of community-wide treatment with single dose of oral azithromycin. If one or more of these villages (dependent upon population) has trachoma rates of 20% or more they will be invited to participate in the azithromycin treatment. In one set of subjects (1 or 2 villages, dependent upon population and infection rate) we will perform treatment, and follow them up at 2-, 12-, and 24-months post-treatment to ascertain infection rates. In a second set of subjects (1 or 2 villages, dependent upon population and infection rate) we will perform treatment, then perform re-treatment at 30-days post initial treatment, and follow them up at 2-, 12-, and 24-months post-treatment to ascertain infection rates. This should help us determine the need for/and the best time for re-treatment to eliminate blinding trachoma, as some recent studies suggest there is a 2-4% failure rate in the initial treatment.

3770,"Completed","Shigellosis is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in many developing countries. The continued emergence of antibiotic resistant strains has complicated the treatment of shigellosis and has increased the cost of treatment markedly. Antimicrobial peptides are considered as endogenous antibiotic. A mixture of these antimicrobial peptides (LL-37 and beta-defensin) drenches the mucosal epithelial surfaces forming a barrier for invading microorganisms. Recently, we found that Shigella down-regulates the expression of LL-37 and beta-defensin 1 (HBD-1) in the colon of patients during acute shigellosis thereby facilitating bacterial invasion. Both LL-37 and HBD-1 could inhibit the growth of various microbes e.g. S. dysenteriae type 1, S. flexneri, and S. boydii. Our study indicated that bacterial DNA might be a potential mediator for the down- regulation in vitro. Down-regulation of LL-37 and HBD-1 was also seen in watery diarrhea caused by other pathogens. Thus, bacteria-mediated down-regulation of our front line defenses could be one strategy evolved by the pathogens to subvert this host-defense mechanism. gene encoding LL-37 in cultured epithelial cell lines were up-regulated when treated with butyrate; butyrate decreased the severity of Shigella infections in rabbit model. We could reproduce our findings from human i.e. downregulation of CAP-18 (the rabbit homologue to human LL-37) in colon epithelia after infection with Shigella flexneri. CAP-18 reappeared after treatment of the infected rabbits with sodium butyrate. Thus, the rabbit model demonstrated the proof of principal.

In most CSD cases resolution occurs in 2 to 3 months although a prolonged course often occurs. Data on the efficacy of antibiotic therapy in CSD is limited. Azithromycin has been shown to have a small favorable effect in a small comparative study and is commonly prescribed for CSD, however its overall effect is not satisfactory. Corticosteroids may be effective in the treatment of CSD for the following reasons:||Many experts believe that host response is involved in the pathogenesis of CSD and is responsible for the clinical manifestations rather than the direct effect of B. henselae. The absence of viable organisms in affected lymph nodes (in the presence of positive PCR for B. henselae DNA), and the fact that arthritis, arthralgia and erythema nodosum (that are often associated with autoimmune diseases) have been described in CSD, support this concept.|Corticosteroids have been anecdotally reported to have been administered to patients with CSD, apparently with some success. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids in addition to azithromycin in CSD. The study hypothesis is that corticosteroids will improve out come. Ten patients with typical CSD will be treated with a 5-day oral course of prednisone (1 mg/kg up to 60 mg/day) and azithromycin (500 mg on day 1 and 250 mg on days 2-5). Patients will be under followed up for 3 months. Major outcome measures will include duration of symptoms and signs, with particular emphasis on affected lymph node size and duration using a specific scoring system (lymphadenitis score, LS). LS will be used to evaluate lymphadenitis at each follow-up visit. The time period from baseline LS until 75% and 90% reduction in LS in the treatment group will be compared with historical controls.

Methods: A multicentre, superiority, open-label, randomized, phase IV-III, two-armed parallel (1:1) groups clinical trial. Adult patients with MSSA bacteremia will be randomized to Combination therapy group: patients will receive intravenous cloxacillin 2g/4h and fosfomycin 3 g/6h for the duration of 7 days treatment, or Standard therapy group: patients will receive intravenous cloxacillin 2g/4h for the duration of 7 days IV treatment. After the first week, antibiotic treatment and duration will be decided by responsible clinician following clinical practice.||The primary endpoint is the treatment success measured at day 7 of treatment; a composite endpoint defined by all of the following criteria met after randomization: patient alive at day 7 AND stable or improved quick SOFA score (compared with baseline) at day 7 AND fever resolved at day 7 AND negative blood cultures for S. aureus at day 7.||In case of achieving statistical differences in the primary endpoint, investigators will perform a hierarchical analysis of the treatment success at Test of Cure visit (TOC, 12 weeks after randomization), defined by the presence of all of the following: patient alive at TOC AND no evidence of microbiological treatment failure defined as isolation of S. aureus from blood culture or other sterile site from day 8 after randomization until TOC.||Investigators have assumed a 74% of treatment success in monotherapy group.

Between 2007 and 2012, Angkor Hospital for Children (AHC), Siem Reap, Cambodia documented that S. pneumoniae was responsible for around 10% of bloodstream infections in hospitalised children, with a case fatality rate of 15.6%.||The use of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV), covering between 7 and 13 of the >90 pneumococcal serotypes, has resulted in significant declines in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) incidence in countries where they are included in routine childhood immunisation schedules. Paediatric radiologic pneumonia incidence is also reduced by PCV, but the impact on clinical pneumonia is minimal. The vaccines have had an effect on reducing the burden of drug resistant IPD, although this may not be sustained. Given the large number of serotypes not included in the current PCV formulations, it is not surprising that initial declines in overall IPD incidence have been eroded by, for the time being, small increases in IPD due to non-vaccine serotypes. To date most data on this serotype replacement disease has come from high-income countries.

This subgroup is designated by the acronym PANDAS (Pediatric Autoimmune Neuropsychiatric Disorders Associated with Streptococcal infections). There are five clinical characteristics that define the PANDAS subgroup: presence of OCD and/or tic disorder; prepubertal symptom onset; sudden onset or abrupt exacerbations (relapsing-remitting course); association with neurological abnormalities (presence of adventitious movements or motoric hyperactivity during exacerbations); and temporal association between symptom exacerbations and GABHS infections. In this subgroup, periodic exacerbations appear to be triggered by GABHS infections in a manner similar to that of Sydenham's chorea, the neurological variant of rheumatic fever.||Rheumatic fever is a disorder with a presumed post-streptococcal autoimmune etiology. The streptococcal pathogenesis of rheumatic fever is supported by studies that have demonstrated the effectiveness of penicillin prophylaxis in preventing recurrences of this illness. A trial of penicillin prophylaxis in the PANDAS subgroup demonstrated that penicillin was not superior to placebo as prophylaxis against GABHS infections in these children, but this outcome was felt to be secondary to non-compliance with treatment, and there was no decrease in the number of neuropsychiatric symptom exacerbations in this group. In a study comparing azithromycin and penicillin, both drugs were completely effective in preventing streptococcal infections - there were no documented titer elevations during the year-long study period for children taking either penicillin or azithromycin. Comparable reductions in the severity of tics and obsessive-compulsive symptoms were also observed. Thus, penicillin was not performing as an ""active placebo"" as originally postulated, but rather provided effective prophylaxis against Group A beta-hemolytic streptococcal. Both azithromycin and penicillin appear to be effective in eliminating GABHS infections, and reducing neuropsychiatric symptom severity; thus, between-group differences are negligible. Since increasing the ""n"" to demonstrate superiority of one prophylactic agent over another would be impractical, we have amended the study design to address two issues:||To determine if antibiotics prophylaxis against GABHS infections is superior to placebo in prolonging periods of remission among children in the PANDAS subgroup.|To determine if antibiotics prophylaxis against GABHS infections is superior to placebo in improving overall symptom severity for obsessive-compulsive symptoms and tics among children in the PANDAS subgroup.||Because penicillin has a narrower therapeutic index and is less expensive than azithromycin, it is the preferable prophylactic agent. Further, penicillin (250 mg orally twice a day) has a long history of providing safe and effective prophylaxis for rheumatic fever and is the first line oral therapy recommended by the American Heart Association.

Since the advent of antibiotics in the 1930s, NG has developed resistance to every first-line antibiotic. Parenteral third-generation cephalosporins are now the only class of drug with consistent efficacy against NG. New therapies are urgently needed. Although some novel antimicrobials are under development, reevaluating older drugs is another option for quickly identifying additional treatments for gonorrhea. We propose a demonstration study to test a single dose of gentamicin for the treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea. We chose to focus on pharyngeal gonorrhea because these infections are common, play an important role in fostering gonococcal resistance, and are harder to eradicate than genital infections. Although gentamicin is 91% efficacious for genital NG, its efficacy at the pharynx may be less since streptomycin, another aminoglycoside previously used to treat gonorrhea, was not effective for pharyngeal NG. It is unknown if streptomycin's poor efficacy is indicative of limitations of aminoglycosides as a class. We plan to enroll 60 men who have sex with men in a demonstration study to be conducted at the Seattle & King County STD Clinic to test the efficacy of 360 mg of gentamicin given intramuscularly for pharyngeal gonorrhea. Secondary objectives include determining the ideal pharmacodynamic criterion (comparing in vitro minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of NG to peak gentamicin serum levels), estimating resistance induction among treatment failures, and assessing the tolerability of 360 mg of IM gentamicin.||Objectives||The proposed study aims to evaluate the efficacy of a single intramuscular (IM) dose of gentamicin in the treatment of pharyngeal gonorrhea.

A short duration (8 days; SD) vs. long duration (15 days; LD) of antibiotic therapy has a comparable clinical efficacy with less antibiotic use and less multidrug-resistant pathogens (MDR) emergence. These results have led the American Thoracic Society to recommend SD therapy for VAP, with the exception of documented VAP of non-fermenting Gram negative bacilli (NF-GNB), including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA-VAP), due to the absence of studies focusing specifically on PA-VAP. Thus the beneficial effect of SD therapy in PA-VAP is still a matter of debate. In a small (n=127) subgroup analysis, a higher rate of recurrence with SD therapy (n=21, 32.8%) has been observed compared with LD therapy group (n=12, 19.0%). Unfortunately, the definition of recurrence was essentially based on microbiological rather than clinical data, and the higher rate of recurrence observed could rather reflect a higher rate of colonization more than a new infection.||Interestingly, a trend for a lower rate of mortality was also observed in the SD group (n=15, 23.4%) compared with the LD group (n=19, 30.2%), but this study was clearly underpowered to detect a difference of mortality between groups.||The two strategies were considered as not different, for the risk of mortality in a recent meta-analysis, performed on the very few available studies (n=2), that (OR = 1.33, 95% CI [0.33 to 5.26] for SD vs. LD strategies respectively).

Targeting prevention interventions to MSM at highest risk of seroconversion is an important goal of combination prevention interventions. Antecedent diagnosis of another sexually transmitted infection (STI), particularly syphilis, may serve as an entry point for biomedical prevention as these individuals are at highest risk for incident HIV. The use of the antiretroviral combination of tenofovir/emtricitabine has been shown to be associated with an overall 44% reduction in HIV acquisition in high-risk MSM when taken daily as PrEP. In those individuals with detectable drug levels, the benefit was as high as 90% risk reduction. In real-world evaluations of PrEP, high-risk sexual behaviour may continue as evidenced by high rates of intercurrent sexually transmitted infections. As such, biomedical interventions that may offer additional reduction in acquisition of common sexually transmitted infections should also be evaluated.||Recently a small pilot study has demonstrated potential benefit from a similar strategy for syphilis prevention. In this study 30 MSM were randomized to receive either 100mg doxycycline once daily or contingency management strategies linked to remaining free of sexually transmitted diseases at progressive study visits.

From 1979 to 2000, sepsis resulted in over 10 million admissions to hospital in the United States with a mortality rate of 17.9 to 27.8 percent. In Canada, it is estimated that the incidence of sepsis from 2008-2009 was 103.3 per 100,000 per year.||Advances in the multifaceted management of sepsis in recent years have resulted in improved clinical outcomes. However, the cornerstone of sepsis management relies on the prompt administration of appropriate antibiotics. Current clinical practice suggests that antibiotic administration can be delayed up to 45 minutes in order to obtain blood cultures, whose results have a profound impact on the type and duration of antimicrobial therapy. Unfortunately, this recommendation is based on very little evidence and the investigators have found that potential life-saving treatment is often delayed in order to abide by it. Furthermore, recent data suggest that mortality could be increased by approximately 5% by delaying antibiotic administration for that time period.||The investigators therefore wish to organize a prospective, multi-centre trial in order to identify the effect of antibiotic administration on blood culture positivity in patients presenting with severe sepsis or septic shock. Other objectives will be to elucidate which patient factors, including age, co-morbid conditions and clinical presentation, as well as antibiotic choice will affect blood culture results.||This study will be conducted in the emergency departments at St. Paul's Hospital (SPH), Vancouver General Hospital (VGH), Lion's Gate Hospital (LGH), Surrey Memorial Hospital, Montreal General Hospital (MGH), Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) and Maricopa Integrated Health System. Patients identified for the aforementioned conditions will be treated as per routine hospital protocol. If the patient is deemed eligible for the study, a second set of blood of blood cultures will subsequently be drawn ideally between 30 and 60 minutes after the administration of antibiotic therapy. Subject demographic data will be collected pertaining to age, comorbid immunocompromised conditions, vital signs, laboratory tests pertaining to end organ dysfunction, suspected source of sepsis, the type antibiotics administered and the timing of antimicrobial administration with respect to the second set of blood cultures taken.||Our hypothesis is that blood culture positivity in patients presenting with severe sepsis and septic shock will not be altered significantly by antibiotic therapy. If so, our study would strongly argue against delaying life-saving therapy and would thus greatly improve patient care in our local emergency rooms.

Since TBE and LB are both endemic with high incidence rates in Slovenia, we should be attentive to the possibility of double infections. Double infections with TBE virus and Lyme borreliae were reported to occur rarely even in endemic countries, however reliable data on coinfection rates are rather limited. Microbiological diagnosis of TBE virus infection is quite straightforward, and there is no specific therapy for TBE available so far. This markedly differs from borrelial infection, in which case interpretation of serological test results demands more caution, but there is highly efficient antibiotic treatment available for LB. This may lead to over prescribing of antibiotics to TBE patients with documented borrelial antibodies in serum indicating possible coinfection with Lyme borreliae, but missing clinical or microbiological criteria for proven borrelial coinfection. Approximately 10% of patients who had been treated appropriately for LB and about one third of patients after TBE report nonspecific subjective complaints, such as fatigue, headache, arthralgia, and myalgia, termed post-Lyme and post-encephalitic symptoms, respectively. These may not be differentiated clearly from nonspecific symptoms occurring with a rather substantial incidence also in the general population.

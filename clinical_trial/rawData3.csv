The antibiotherapy is then adapted to the bacteria from samples collected during the surgery when they are identified (the delay is 14-21 days).||The study will focus on bacteria identified on samples collected during the surgery; the delay between the implantation of the prosthesis and the presentation of symptoms will be considered : more than one year vs. less than one year.||Investigators assume that there is not the same type of bacteria involved in those two cases of delays and that the probabilistic antibiotherapy may be not optimal when the symptoms are presented more than one year after implantation of the prosthesis.

2009,"Completed","Bacterial vaginosis (BV) develops when the concentration of healthy Lactobacillus species in the vagina declines and is replaced by other bacterial species. BV is the most common vaginal infection worldwide, but the etiology of this complex condition is not clear. BV is associated with a 60% increased risk of HIV acquisition as well as numerous other detrimental reproductive outcomes. A profound racial disparity exists in BV prevalence in women in the United States (US): 23% of white women versus. 52% of black women have BV. The investigators hypothesize that inadequate vitamin D contributes to BV development and/or recurrence. Vitamin D is essential to immune function, serving both to stimulate mechanisms associated with pathogen elimination and to regulate immune response. According to nationally-representative data, 90% of US blacks have insufficient vitamin D levels. In two recent analyses, low vitamin D was associated with higher BV prevalence in pregnant African-Americans; a third replicated this finding in pregnant African-American and white women. The investigators wish to conduct a small, pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation among non-pregnant, BV-positive women at a public sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic. This small (n=150), two-arm, placebo-controlled, masked, 24-week RCT of high-dose vitamin D supplementation will inform the development of future large-scale RCT design and implementation.","Bacterial Vaginosis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","September 2011","January 2013","Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol)|Placebo","Dietary Supplement|Dietary Supplement","Not Applicable","Female","50 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","United States","Randomized","118",,

However, it was suggested that resistance to fluoroquinolones has been increasing in the Korean population and the resistance is most likely mediated through point mutation in gyrA. Gemifloxacin (FACTIVE®) is an enhanced-affinity, broad-spectrum fluoroquinolone suitable for once-daily, oral dosing. In vitro studies have shown that gemifloxacin displays potent activity against Gram-positive organisms, whilst retaining good activity against Gram-negative organisms. Gemifloxacin is the most potent member of the quinolone class against S. pneumoniae with activities 16-64 times greater than those of ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin and 2-8 times greater than those of moxifloxacin. Importantly, gemifloxacin displays potent in vitro activity against strains of S. pneumoniae with known resistance to β-lactams, macrolides and other members of the quinolone class. This potent activity is believed to be due to the enhanced affinity of gemifloxacin for topoisomerase IV, the major fluoroquinolone target in S. pneumoniae. Furthermore, gemifloxacin displays potent activity against H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis and atypical organisms such as L. pneumophila, C. pneumoniae and M. pneumoniae.

2103,"Completed","Background: Severe dehydrating cholera due to V. cholerae O1 is an important public health problem in Bangladesh and many other developing countries. V. cholerae O1 is a major bacterial pathogen causing around 5 million cases and at least 200,000 deaths in adults and children each year. It can be assumed that there are at least 300,000 severe cases and 1.2 million infections in people in Bangladesh alone. The rate of cholera varies from around 1 to 8 per 1000 population and the highest attack rate is in children 2- to 9-year years of age . Cholera is now also being documented in very young children. Currently enteric vaccine approaches are regarded as the most accessible short term and practical means to prevent and control such illnesses to prevent disease and epidemics in resource poor settings with limited public health and sanitary facilities.||An effective inactivated whole cell bivalent cholera vaccine against Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 was produced and implemented for public health purposes in Vietnam since the 1990s. This bivalent vaccine has been found to be safe and to confer significant protection against El Tor cholera in both children and adults and has over the last decade being used in the Vietnam to protect against cholera. This vaccine has further been reformulated by the IVI to meet WHO requirements and is now being produced in WHO prequalified vaccine company in India.||The reformulated vaccine has been shown to be safe and immunogenic in Indian children as well as adults. A large Phase III study of the vaccine, has recently been carried out in Kolkata, India in over 120,000 participants aged from one year and above. Results of the study are encouraging and the vaccine gives over 60% protection against cholera. The vibriocidal antibody response rate was 80% in children and 53% in adults. Following this study, the vaccine, designated as ShanChol has been licensed in India in April 2009. The vaccine is now being marketed in India and is available at a cost affordable for developing country settings.||Objective: The aim of the proposed study is to assess if the orally administered, killed, bivalent whole-cell cholera vaccine, ShanChol will be safe and immunogenic in different age groups in Bangladesh in children and adults.||Study design: This will be a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled study on a total of 330 subjects, 165 vaccine and 165 placebo recipients. The specific aims will be to determine: i) safety and determine adverse events if any (ii) determine immune responses.||Relevance: The study of ShanChol on Bangladeshi children and adults will be able to give information regarding the safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in Bangladeshi subjects. This information will be important for proceeding with larger studies in Bangladesh and if proven useful for introduction the cholera vaccine in the country in the future.","Healthy","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","January 2010","November 2010","ShanChol Cholera Vaccine|Placebo","Biological|Other","Phase 2","All","45 Years","12 Months","Health Services Research","Parallel Assignment","Bangladesh","Randomized","330",,

Although the majority of these infections are limited to the skin and soft tissue and thus not life threatening, the number of invasive cases in otherwise healthy individuals is increasing and some are fatal. As a first step toward understanding pathogenesis, there has been significant focus on elucidating the key CA-MRSA virulence factors. The relative significance of these factors is still being delineated. By comparison, there has been little focus on host factors associated with these invasive infections. In this protocol, we will recruit 100 otherwise healthy subjects with invasive staphylococcal infection, 50 otherwise healthy subjects with recurrent staphylococcal infections, and obtain samples from 150 unidentified healthy controls from the blood bank to investigate host immunologic factors predisposing people to staphylococcal infection.

WHO recommends intermittent preventive treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) with sulphadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) for asymptomatic women, but high-level parasite resistance to SP threatens its efficacy. Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) has the potential to replace SP for IPTp. However, the DP strategy has not been found to be superior to SP for reducing the incidence of low birthweight (LBW), small-for-gestational age (SGA), or preterm birth. This may be the result of sulphadoxine having antibacterial properties; it is derived from sulphonamide, which have been used for decades to treat curable STIs/RTIs. However, SP is unlikely to be curative of STIs/RTIs, nor highly effective against malaria parasites. Thus, combination treatment that contains a more efficacious antimalarial and a more efficacious anti-STI/RTI may produce better birth outcomes.

Invasive GAS infection is defined by the isolation of GAS from a normally sterile site (e.g., blood) or by the isolation of GAS from a nonsterile site in the presence of the streptococcal toxic shock syndrome or necrotizing fasciitis. A postpartum case of invasive GAS is defined as isolation of GAS during the postpartum period, in association with a clinical postpartum infection (e.g., endometritis) or from either a sterile site or a wound infection.||Because of the burden and severity of invasive GAS infection, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) hosted a meeting in to formulate guidelines for responding to postpartum and postsurgical GAS infections.

2158,"Completed","Background: Helicobacter pylori infection has been shown to be associated with the development of gastric cancer and peptic ulcer diseases. Eradication of H. pylori infection could reduce the occurence or recurrence of these diseases. However, it was estimated that 15-20% of patients would fail from first line standard eradication therapy and need second line rescue therapy. About 15-30% of patient would fail from second line therapy and need to be rescued with third line therapy. The commonly used salvage regimens include (1) Bismuth based quadruple therapy (combined with ranitidine or PPI plus two antibiotics) (2) Levofloxacin or moxifloxacin or rifabutin based triple therapy. However, Bismuth is not available in many countries and the administration method is complex. Its usage is limited by the high pill number and low compliance rate. In recent years, the concept of sequential therapy has been advocated in the treatment of H. pylori infection. The regimen includes a PPI plus amoxicillin for five days, followed by a PPI plus clarithromycin and metronidazole for another five days. The eradication rate in the first line treatment of sequential therapy had been reported to be as high as 90%. More importantly, it has been demonstrated that the eradication rate among patients with clarithromycin-resistant strains could be as high as 89%. According to the Maastricht III consensus meeting, it was recommended that susceptibility test should be done for patients who failed two treatments. Therefore, we aimed to assess the efficacy of susceptibility test driven sequential therapy as the third line therapy for those who fail from two standard eradication therapies.||Methods: This will be a multi-center, open labeled pilot study||Patients:||Open labeled, non-comparative pilot study||Testing for H. pylori infection:||Before salvage treatment:||either (1) any two positive of CLO test, histology, and culture or (2) a positive C13-UBT will be considered as failure of previous eradication treatment EGD with gastric biopsy will be done for H. pylori culture and susceptibility test||After salvage treatment: C13-UBT will be used to assess the existence of H. pylori after 2nd or 3rd line salvage therapy||Treatment regimens and assignment:||D1-7: Nexium (40 mg, bid), Amolin (1 gm, bid)|D8-14: Nexium (40 mg, bid), Flagyl (500 mg, bid) plus either one of the following according to antibiotic susceptibility test (1) Klaricid, 500 mg, bid or (2) Cravit, 250 mg, bid or (3) Tetracycline, 500 mg, bid||Outcome Measurement:||Primary End Point: Eradication rate will be evaluated according to Intent-to-treat (ITT) and per-protocol (PP) analyses|Secondary End Point: the eradication rate according to antibiotic susceptibility before salvage therapy","Helicobacter Pylori Infection","No","Interventional","April 2009","March 2012","susceptibility test guided sequential therapy","Drug","Phase 4","All",,"20 Years","Treatment","Single Group Assignment","Taiwan","Non-Randomized","134",,

As pneumococcal vaccines provide serotype-specific protection, it is important to induce sufficient immune responses for the most clinically relevant serotypes. All adults aged 65 years or older are recommended to receive PPSV23 vaccination irrespective of underlying medical conditions. Thus, since May 2013, South Korea introduced PPSV23 in the national immunization program for elderly individuals aged ≥65 years. Following PPSV23 vaccination, serotype-specific IgG concentrations and OPA titers increase and then decline over time thereby decreasing protective efficacy, although these might remain above pre-vaccination levels until 5 years from PPSV23 administration. The decline of pneumococcal immunity may be more prominent among chronically ill patients, including those with diabetes. Currently however, revaccination is not recommended. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the serotype specific immunogenicity between healthy elderly people and old adults with diabetes after revaccination with PPSV23 at the age of 70-75 years.

Prevention through vaccination therefore remains a key public health priority. Research from national ""meningitis"" vaccine programmes against MenC, Hib and Streptococcus pneumoniae show us that their success is in part due to their ability to protect both the vaccinated and the unvaccinated, so-called herd immunity. This protection probably occurs by reducing carriage of these meningitis bacteria in the back of the throat (mucosal immunity). How this happens is poorly understood but our research shows that naturally acquired immunity (transient contact between the immune system and the meningococcus in the back of the throat without causing disease) may impact on this process. We believe that to develop a MenB vaccine that is able to cause mucosal immunity and prevent MenB carriage, it is important to understand the interaction between natural immunity and vaccination. In this study we propose to administer MenB vaccine to adults in order to investigate this process. Our findings will provide important insights into Men B immunity, inform the design of novel vaccine strategies and allow the rational testing of new vaccines as they become available.","Meningococcal Infections","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","September 2009","November 2011","NZ MenB OMV vaccine (NZ98/254)","Biological","Phase 2","All","40 Years","16 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","United Kingdom|United Kingdom","Randomized","9",,

While this suggests that coadministration causes an interaction resulting in a greater risk of adverse events following Immunization (AEFI) only the AEFI after the 4CMenB dose and not those occurring after routine vaccine immunizations were reported, underestimating the total risk associated with immunization at separate visits.

Tuberculosis is a major global health problem whose solution requires development of an effective vaccine. However, incomplete understanding of how immunity to MTB is acquired and measured limits vaccine development. This study will focus on certain immune system cells - CD4+ T cells - that appear to be very important in fighting tuberculosis.||Individuals 16 years of age and older who have or have not been exposed to either tuberculosis or HIV, or both, may be eligible for this study. Candidates will be screened with a medical history, physical examination, blood tests, review of medical records and laboratory tests, and, if medically indicated, a chest x-ray. Individuals whose medical records indicate a past history of tuberculosis or a positive test for exposure to tuberculosis will have a tuberculin skin test. For this test, a few drops of fluid are placed under the skin to see if the immune system reacts to the substance, indicating previous exposure to MTB.||Participants will come to the University of Mali 10 times over a 1-year period - 7 times within the first 3 months of the study and then once every 3 months until 1 year after enrollment. At each study visit, they will be asked about their medical history and will donate 75 milliliters (about 1/3 cup) of blood, totaling 830 mL over the entire year. More blood may be requested if the participant's immune system reacts strongly to MTB in laboratory tests. No more than 450 mL (2 cups) of blood would be collected every 6 weeks; this amount is the Red Cross limit for regular blood donations every 6 weeks.||The blood samples will be used for tests that measure the level of immunity to tuberculosis.

In 2000, a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) was licensed for use in children and is now part of the routine childhood vaccine schedule. PCV is known to reduce invasive disease and protect against nasopharyngeal (NP) acquisition of vaccine serotype pneumococci; it also results in an increased risk of nonvaccine serotype carriage. This study proposes to assess the longterm impact of vaccine on NP carriage in a setting where there is intense antibody pressure on the ecology of the pneumococcus. A cross sectional study of pneumococcal NP colonization among American Indian children will be combined with surveillance for invasive disease in the same population. The purpose is to determine the impact of community wide PCV use on NP colonization and the relationship with invasive disease. This longterm safety issue needs to be assessed to fully evaluate the impact of vaccine on NP ecology and invasive disease.","Pneumococcal Infections","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","March 2006","April 2008",,,,"All",,,,,"United States",,"1000",,

It shows a strong seasonality, with epidemic potential especially after heavy rainfall. A recent systematic review by Costa et al. (2015) places leptospirosis among the leading zoonotic causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide, with 1.03 million cases and 58,900 deaths each year.||Leptospirosis is an important public health problem, particularly within economically vulnerable populations. It is also emerging as a health threat in new settings due to globalization and climate change. Disasters and extreme weather events are recognized to precipitate epidemics.||Clinical manifestations are highly polymorphic, ranging from an anicteric, influenza-like form to severe forms with hepato-renal or pulmonary failures which are associated with high mortality.||Antibiotic therapy should be prescribed early, as soon as leptospirosis is suspected and preferably within the first 5 days, before leptospira spread to the tissues. In the treatment of mild forms, usual antibiotics are oral amoxicillin or doxycycline for a standard treatment duration of 7 days. In hospitalized cases of leptospirosis, parenteral antibiotic therapy with ceftriaxone is often favored as first-line therapy.||The most widely used antibiotics in the French Caribbean and Indian Ocean regions are amoxicillin, doxycyclin and third generation cephalosporins such as ceftriaxone.||Research hypothesis:||The effects of shorter antibiotic therapy periods for other infectious diseases have been explored by several authors. The efficacy of short ceftriaxone treatment has been highlighted for typhoid fever or meningococcal meningitis. In a retrospective series of 21 cases, the interest of short treatment periods (3-6 days) for mild and severe leptospirosis has also been described. A minimal 3-day therapy period would seem necessary in order to biologically confirm leptospirosis diagnosis and to rule out other community-acquired infections.||Our study proposal is the conduct of a non-inferiority trial comparing a shortened antibiotic therapy period of 3 days with the standard treatment period of 7 days in patients with mild leptospirosis and seen at the hospital in 5 French overseas departments (Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Reunion, Mayotte).||Originality and innovative aspects:||To our knowledge, the efficacy of a 3-day antibiotic therapy for mild leptospirosis, as compared to the standard 7 day period, has not yet been explored.||In addition, the LEPTO3 study will be among the first clinical trials to focus on the endemic public health problem, which is leptospirosis, at a large geographical level (Caribbean and Indian Ocean regions) and to involve a high level of collaboration between medical and scientific teams of these territories.","Mild Leptospirosis","No","Interventional","April 1, 2020","May 31, 2023","3 days of antibiotherapy","Drug","Phase 4","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","French Guiana|Guadeloupe|Martinique|Mayotte|Réunion","Randomized","220",,

Some restrictions apply for live vaccines; administering a live-virus vaccine within 4 weeks after administration of another live-virus vaccine can decrease immunogenicity to the second administered vaccine.

Although the risk of immunological interference due to co-administration of live vaccines with non-live vaccines is considered small if at all, a theoretical concern of interference has been raised. Given the substantial geographic correlation between polio- and cholera-affected and at-risk areas, which include some of the world's most impoverished and hard-to-reach populations, a strategy of co-administration of OCV with OPV to children targeted to receive OPVs has the potential to optimize the use of limited resources and improve coverage for both vaccines.

Until recently there has been no serogroup A conjugate vaccine available to prevent epidemics in Africa because none of the major pharmaceutical companies wanted to develop such a vaccine for commercial reasons. For this reason a public private partnership was established in 2001, the Meningitis Vaccine Project (MVP), with support from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, to develop an affordable new serogroup A meningococcal conjugate vaccine for Africa. The new vaccine, MenAfriVac™, received WHO pre-qualification in 2010 and mass campaigns started in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger in 2010. It is expected that full coverage through mass vaccination campaigns will be achieved by the end of 2011 in these three countries.

Used as an adjunct to management of dehydration, antimicrobial therapy using an appropriate agent reduces diarrhoea duration and stool volume in severe cholera by about half.||The usefulness of antimicrobials has, however, been greatly eroded by the increasing prevalence of resistant strains of V. cholerae O1. From October 2004 at the Matlab Hospital and from December 2004 at the Dhaka Hospital of ICDDR, B, V. cholerae strains became increasingly resistant to tetracycline and erythromycin- two drugs used in the treatment of severe cholera in adults and children respectively. Because of this high prevalence of resistance we resorted in early 2005 to using ciprofloxacin for treatment against multi drug resistant V. cholerae. Although all isolates were susceptible to ciprofloxacin when standard thresholds for disc-diffusion or E-test were used, but majority of the strains demonstrated a MIC value of 0.250 µg/ml, over hundred-folds greater than the V. cholerae strains tested in earlier years, which generally had a MIC of <0.003 µg/ml.||In this randomized, double blind, controlled trial we will assess clinical and bacteriological response to 12 hourly oral dose of ciprofloxacin for 3 days in which the first two doses will be 1 g each and the later 4 doses will be 500 mg each, and compare them with a single 1 g oral dose of azithromycin.

It affects all age groups with the majority of fatal cases occurring in children . Therefore, immunization against cholera remains an important public health component in the prevention and control of the disease .The current two-dose regimen of the internationally available oral cholera vaccines (OCV) create a logistical and programmatic challenge for use in national programs or during epidemics ,so it is important to determine if a single dose vaccine will be protective in regions where cholera is endemic. If the vaccine is found to be efficacious following a single dose, this will have profound implications for the use of the vaccine in areas with limited resources particularly in complex emergencies where a multiple dose regimen is difficult to deploy. A single-dose regimen of this vaccine will improve its 'field ability' and allow the vaccine to be used for outbreak control, especially in difficult settings where the risk of cholera is extremely high and provisions for clean water and sanitation are not available. With low OCV production rates, larger populations could be immunized against cholera if a single dose is found to be efficacious. A single-dose schedule could facilitate the inclusion of a global stockpile strategy.||The study design is a two-arm individually randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

2588,"Completed","In cholera, the function of small intestine is affected resulting in increased secretion of electrolytes and water and their reduced absorption leading to profuse watery diarrhoea. The human colon has the capacity to absorb water and electrolytes. A number of recent studies have shown that short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) such as acetate, butyrate and propionate stimulates absorption of sodium in the colon, which is not affected by cyclic AMP. It has also been shown that SCFAs inhibits c-AMP mediated chloride secretion in the colon. Benefiber (partially hydrolyzed guar gum) is water soluble fibre, and when added to ORS it undergoes fermentation in the colon liberating SCFAs. SCFAs not only serves as metabolic fuel to the enterocytes but they also enhance colonic absorption of salts and water. Thus, they have potentials to reduce the severity of diarrhoea in patients with cholera. The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of Benefiber-added WHO-ORS in the management of adults with cholera. In this randomized, controlled clinical trial, a total of 174 adult males with cholera would be studied. Study patients would be selected from those who attend the Dhaka Hospital of ICDDR,B with a history of diarrhoea of less than 24 hours and signs of severe dehydration. They would be rehydrated using intravenous fluid (cholera saline) over 4 hrs during which a stool specimen would be subjected for dark-field microscopy for identification of V. cholerae. Those identified to have cholera would be randomized in equal numbers to receive either: a) Benefiber (25 g/L) added WHO-ORS, b) Benefiber (50 g/L) added to the new formulation (Na+ 75, glucose 75, Cl- 65, K+ 20 mmol/L, citrate 10 mmol/L, osmolarity 245 mosmol/L) of WHO-ORS , or c) the same WHO-ORS but without Benefiber for maintenance of hydration until resolution of diarrhoea. All patients would be treated with a single, 300 mg dose of doxycycline capsules and would be provided with the standard hospital diets. Fluid intake (intravenous fluid, ORS, and plain water) and output (stool, urine, and vomit) will be measured for each 6-hourly periods of the study. Patients would be hospitalized until resolution of their diarrhoea. Stool output, intake of intravenous fluid and ORS, the duration of diarrhoea, and the proportion of patients requiring ""unscheduled intravenous fluid therapy"" would be compared between the treatment groups.

2589,"Completed","Cholera is a major health problem of many developing countries and marked increase in the prevalence has been seen on all continents in the last decade (WHO 1998). There is a great need for an appropriate vaccine to protect children the principal suffers in endemic countries, from the live threatening consequences of cholera. The B subunit-whole cell killed vaccine (Dukoral) developed in Sweden and used in field trials all over the world. It is licensed in many counties of the world and recommended by WHO. Protective efficacy to the killed vaccine has been demonstrated in adults in Bangladesh as well as in other countries, but less so in children (Clemens et al. 1986). Thus there is an urgency for developing strategies to improve the immunogenicity of vaccines especially for protection of children in cholera endemic countries of the world. Different options for improved cholera vaccines are being considered including new and improved formulations of killed or live oral candidate vaccines (Qadri et al. 2004, Sack et al. 1997, Levine et al. 1993) as well as the use of micronutrient supplementation during the course of immunization (Albert et al. 2003, Karlsen et al. 2003, Qadri et al. 2004). Another option that appears promising is the use of probiotics as adjunct to oral immunization based on the understanding that these agents could improve the mucosal immune responses, both innate and adaptive and help reducing inflammation (Blum and Schiffrin 2003, Fang et al. 2000). A therapeutic as well as preventive role of probiotics has been suggested from results of different studies using different probiotics that have been tested, usually lactic acid producing bacteria such as lactobacillus, Bifidobacterium and Steptococcus species. The supplemention of probiotics to infants may also have a prophylactic effect against acute diarrheal diseases. In pediatric populations, the effect of probiotic agents appears to be most significant against rotavirus diarrhea, suggesting that an immunological mechanism is responsible for the beneficial effects (Saavedra, 2000). In the present proposal we would like to examine if supplementation with the probiotic Bifidobacterium breve has a beneficial role in enhancing the immunogenicity of Dukoral in children. A two cell study will be conducted in which one group of children will be given B. breve every day for four weeks and another group will be given placebo. Two doses of the oral cholera vaccine will be administered at two week interval following initiation of the probiotic/placebo administration. Pre- and post- vaccination blood sample will be collected and assayed for immune response to the vaccine. The frequency and magnitude of the immune response to the vaccine will be compared among the two groups of children to assess whether the probiotic treatment enhances the immune responses to the vaccine. If probiotic supplemenation has a positive effect on the immune response it may be adopted as adjunct to enhance the efficacy of the cholera vaccine in immunization programmes and perhaps also of other enteric vaccines.","Cholera","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","January 2006","December 2008","Whole cell killed cholera vaccine & probiotic","Biological","Not Applicable","All","5 Years","2 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Bangladesh","Randomized","128",,

Today, anthrax is rarely encountered in the United States, since the introduction of vaccines for cattle in the 1930s. A human vaccine was licensed in 1970. Vaccination against anthrax has been confined to people at risk, such as wool sorters and some veterinarians. However, the rising prospects of B. anthracis being used as a weapon have led to routine administration of the anthrax vaccine to members of the armed forces.||Adults who are in good health may be eligible for this study. The involvement of 300 adults is planned.||Participants will have a general physical exam and test for vital signs. There will also be collection of blood for chemistry and hematology; urinalysis; tests for HIV, hepatitis B and C, and liver function; and a pregnancy test, if applicable.||On a random basis, patients will receive one of the rPA formulations. Two doses of rPA will be evaluated, 10 microgram ((Micro)g) and 20 (Micro)g. This evaluation aims to establish the safety and most desirable level of dosage. Patients will receive one injection of the vaccine, administered in the left shoulder or left thigh. About 30 minutes later, their temperature will be taken, and the injection site will be inspected. Rare but severe reactions could occur if there is extreme sensitivity to a vaccine. However, such an occurrence is extremely rare following a vaccine, and if there are any dangerous symptoms, they can be effectively treated by medications available to patients while they are at the clinic. If there are no significant abnormal results, patients may return home. About 6 hours later and daily for 7 days, they will take their temperature and examine the injection site. The vaccine may cause temporary discomfort at the site of injection, and participants may experience a mild fever for 1 or 2 days after vaccination.||Patients will receive diary cards, a digital thermometer, and instructions on taking their temperature and measuring redness and swelling at the injection site, as well as for recording aches, muscle pain, or sensitivity to light for 7 days.

Throughout the past decades, invasive fungal infections (IFIs) are of increasing importance even in non-neutropenic patients who are in need of treatment in intensive care units (ICU) or have undergone major surgeries. Several factors like parenteral nutrition, central venous catheters, broad spectrum antibiotics admission, disturbance of gastrointestinal mucosa integrity have been associated with an increased incidence of IFIs.

2632,"Completed","Invasive Candida infections are serious complications in immunocompromised patients including those undergoing treatment for cancer but occur also in patients treated in ICUs. Survival rate of invasive candidiasis is associated with early initiation of antifungal therapy (15% mortality rate for candidemic patients with antifungal therapy on day 0 related to the culture date of the first blood sample positive for yeasts compared to 41% for patients who received antifungal therapy on day 3). Up to date, no laboratory method or clinical decision rule is available for correct anticipation of invasive candidiasis which would avoid delays in appropriate antifungal therapy initiation. In clinical practice culture based methods (e.g. blood cultures) miss up to 50% of invasive candidiasis cases. Preemptive antifungal therapy is therefore often initiated in critically ill patients after Candida has been isolated from various non-sterile patient samples even without any sufficient evidence for invasive candidiasis. The disadvantages of this approach include over- and undertreatment of patients (up to 50% of candidemia cases are missed, and on the other hand 89% patients are treated unnecessarily), increased selective pressure for the development of antifungal resistance, potential risk of adverse drug reactions, and increased costs (expenses for antifungal therapy account for half of the antimicrobial medication budget in tertiary care hospitals). In addition, no survival benefit could be demonstrated by this strategy in ICU patients.||The aim of this study is to identify biological markers to anticipate or support the diagnosis of invasive candidiasis in ICU patients, to overcome current deficiencies in detection of invasive candidiasis and consequently to differentiate between Candida spp. colonization and invasive Candida infection. The investigators intend to examine time dependent courses of potential host and pathogen derived biomarkers as well as innate or acquired predispositions for invasive candidiasis; e.g. automated (1→3) ß- D- Glucan tests, DNA in serum blood samples, pathogen recognition receptors and serum markers like interleukin (IL)-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-22, IL-23, Tryptophan, Kynurenine, composition of indigenous microbiota of gastrointestinal and lower respiratory tract and skin, and risk factors for invasive candidiasis like underlying diseases and treatments. The study should contribute to improved assessment of ICU patients at risk for invasive candidiasis and to improved diagnosis of invasive candidiasis in ICU patients. In clinical practice the reliable differentiation between infection and colonization will allow more targeted antifungal therapy leading to enhanced antifungal treatment initiation on the one hand (in cases of true invasive candidiasis) and to reduction of unnecessary antifungal treatments and treatment costs on the other hand.","Invasive Candidiasis","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","June 2016","August 2021",,,,"All",,"18 Years",,,"Austria",,"200",,

If untreated, C. trachomatis infection can cause sequelae such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy and tubal factor infertility. C. trachomatis can also cause anorectal infections, which are typically asymptomatic. Among women with urogenital chlamydial infection, around 36-91% also had concurrent anorectal chlamydial. Notably, there was no association with anal intercourse in the studies that reported it. However, guidelines do not recommend routine anorectal testing, but restricted testing in people who are in high-risk groups, report anal sexual behavior, or have anal symptoms, i.e., on selective indications. This is in contrast to urogenital testing, which is a routine procedure in STI care services.||The anal transmission of C. trachomatis in women may occur by autoinoculation from the vagina due to the close proximity of the vagina and the anus.

One of the strategies proposed by stewardship programs to try to change this situation described worldwide is the use of antibiotics with the lowest possible antimicrobial spectrum.||Enterobacteriaceae bacteremia is a good example of how this strategy would be applied. The empirical treatment of nosocomial bacteremia by Enterobacteriaceae comprises in several cases one or two antibiotics with antipseudomonal activity, being much less common than desirable a subsequent change to narrower spectrum antibiotics based on susceptibility data (""de escalation""). This is because the safety of de escalation is based only on expert advice and some observational studies, so their efficacy and safety is questioned by many clinicians and therefore its use is lower than desired. In fact, a recent systematic review of the Cochrane Library concluded that randomized studies to support this practice are needed.

However, recent studies have reported increasing treatment failure that may indicate that resistance to macrolide antibiotics among Chlamydia trachomatis is evolving. Research regarding other bacterial species indicates a high frequency of mutation based resistance in conjunction with azithromycin use, i.e. when treating Mycoplasma genitalium infections.

Ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP) is the commonest hospital-acquired infection (HAI) in ICUs and is associated with a high morbidity and mortality in these vulnerable patients despite antibiotic therapy. No well-designed clinical trials studying antibiotic duration for VAP caused by predominantly non-fermenting Gram-negative bacteria have been conducted to date. Shortening antibiotic duration has the potential to improve individual patient outcomes and indirectly benefit other patients by reducing the selection pressure for multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria within the ICU.||The study aims to demonstrate clinical non-inferiority-superiority of a short duration of antibiotics (up to 7 days) versus prolonged antibiotic therapy (as per physician preference) in adults with VAP in Asia. Patients who have been ventilated for more than 48 hours will be screened daily for signs and symptoms of VAP according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention VAP criteria. Recruited patients will be reviewed daily for clinical signs of stability including temperature <38°C for 48 hours, systolic blood pressure >90mmHg without inotropes. Recruited patients will be randomised once they fulfill these clinical criteria of stability. In the intervention arm, antibiotics should be stopped within 7 days once the above criteria are fulfilled.

An increasing number of Gram-negative bacteria isolates worldwide are resistant to virtually all antibiotics including carbapenems. Although polymyxins are the current gold standard antibiotic for treatment of severe extensively drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (XDR-GNB - defined in Appendix I) infections, resistance development on therapy and treatment failures are common. Combination antibiotics therapy have better in vitro efficacy, but have not been formally tested in a prospective trial.||We will conduct a Phase IIB, prospective, open-label, randomized-controlled trial in 4 major Singaporean hospitals, with balanced treatment assignments achieved by permuted block randomization, stratified by hospital. There will be 75 subjects per arm, with the subjects in the comparator arm receiving standard-dose polymyxin B while the intervention arm will receive a second antibiotic, doripenem, with polymyxin B against the bacterial isolate in question. Subjects with ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) will additionally receive nebulized colistin. The primary outcome is 30-day mortality while secondary outcomes include microbiological clearance, time to defervescence, and toxicity of therapy, presence of secondary infections due to new multi-drug resistant bacteria and length of ICU stay. Plasma drug levels will be measured by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.||Hypothesis:||The underlying primary hypothesis is that combination antibiotic therapy (IV polymyxin B + IV doripenem) is superior to mono-antibiotics therapy (IV polymyxin B) in reducing 30-day mortality from XDR-GNB infections.","Bacteremia|Healthcare-associated Pneumonia|Ventilator-associated Pneumonia","No","Interventional","January 2015","December 2015","Polymyxin B|Polymyxin B + Doripenem","Drug|Drug","Phase 2|Phase 3","All","90 Years","21 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Singapore|Singapore","Randomized","0",,

Continuous or intermittent oropharyngeal aspiration, open system aspiration versus closed system aspiration, extensive oral care, oropharyngeal aspiration prior to patient positioning are some of these applications.||When the patient is turned to position, the outbreak accumulated in the oral cavity is more likely to move to the lower respiratory tract. In this study, it is assumed that aspiration of oropharyngeal secretions prior to each position change will reduce the accumulation of oral secretion in the endotracheal tube cuff and reduce aspiration of contaminated secretion and reduce the risk of developing VIP. This randomized controlled experimental study was planned to confirm the validity of this assumption.||This study was a randomized controlled experimental study designed to investigate the effect of oropharyngeal aspiration on decreasing the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia in patients receiving mechanical ventilation.

2733,"Enrolling by invitation","Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a recommended component of combination HIV prevention and its availability is rising through demonstration projects and full-scale national programs. In sub-Saharan Africa, young women are a priority population for HIV prevention and targeted to initiate PrEP, given their high HIV incidence rates and promising success from a strategy that can be used without the engagement of male partners. A key question in the field is whether young women using PrEP have ongoing HIV risk and adhere to PrEP sufficiently to have protection from HIV when they have condomless sex with HIV-infected partners. The only true way to know whether a heterosexual woman is sexually exposed to HIV or has a partner with high HIV risk is to test for HIV and STIs in her male partner(s) and quantify HIV viral levels, if any are detected. Yet engaging men in clinic-based HIV testing is challenging. More recent efforts have focused on using HIV self-testing kits to respond to demands on men's time and reluctance to seeking preventive healthcare. The availability of PrEP also provides a new incentive for men to test.||By leveraging an ongoing study of bone health with concurrent use of PrEP and injectable DMPA (often known as Depo Provera® or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate), we have opportunity to engage a new cohort of young men and objectively measure HIV and common STIs in these young men and link the results to women's use of PrEP. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether young women's adherence to PrEP aligns with the HIV status and risk of their male partners. To address its primary objectives, this study will leverage: 1) an ongoing study among young women and 2) a novel cohort of young men who are current sexual partners of the young women in the ongoing study to objectively measure PrEP use, HIV, and HIV factors related to HIV risk. This study will provide a framework for understanding how and when young women and men decide to take PrEP, estimate the proportion of women that are benefitting from HIV protection when they have male partners with or at high risk of acquiring HIV, and provide a novel opportunity to engage young men in PrEP delivery and as supporters of women's PrEP use.","Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis|Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Bacterial|HIV Infections","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","August 30, 2020","December 31, 2021","Diagnostic test for NG/CT|HIV testing","Diagnostic Test|Diagnostic Test","Phase 4","Male",,"18 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Uganda","Non-Randomized","500",,

Centers for Disease Control (CDC) CA-MRSA guidelines include incision and drainage, antibiotic sensitivity testing and antibiogram-directed prescribing. Re-infections are common, ranging from 16% to 43%, and present significant challenges to clinicians, patients and their families. Several decolonization and decontamination interventions have been shown to reduce Hospital-Acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA) re-infection and transmission in intensive care units. Few studies examine the feasibility and effectiveness of these infection prevention interventions into primary care settings, and none employ Community Health Workers (CHWs) or ""promotoras"" to provide home visits for education and interventions about decolonization and decontamination.

Clinical Directors Network (CDN), an established, NIH-recognized best practice Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC) Practice-based Research Network (PBRN), and The Rockefeller University propose to address this question through the completion of four aims: (1) To evaluate the comparative effectiveness of a CHW/Promotora-delivered home intervention (Experimental Group) as compared to Usual Care (Control Group) on the primary patient-centered and clinical outcome (SSTI recurrence rates) and secondary patient-centered and clinical outcomes (pain, depression, quality of life, care satisfaction) using a two-arm randomized controlled trial (RCT). (2) To understand the patient-level factors (CA-MRSA infection prevention knowledge, self-efficacy, decision-making autonomy, prevention behaviors/adherence) and environmental-level factors (household surface contamination, household member colonization, transmission to household members) that are associated with differences in SSTI recurrence rates. (3) To understand interactions of the intervention with bacterial genotypic and phenotypic variables on decontamination, decolonization, SSTI recurrence, and household transmission.

Here we show that the B38-CAP, a carboxypeptidase derived from Paenibacillus sp. B38, is an ACE2-like enzyme to decrease angiotensin II levels in mice. In protein 3D structure analysis, B38-CAP homolog shares structural similarity to mammalian ACE2 with low sequence identity. A study demonstrated that the bacterial B38-CAP as an ACE2-like carboxypeptidase, indicating that evolution has shaped a bacterial carboxypeptidase to a human ACE2-like enzyme. Bacterial engineering could be utilized to design improved protein drugs for hypertension and heart failure. pretreatment of B38-CAP markedly down regulated a massive increase of plasma Ang II levels at 5 min after Ang II injection In addition to the currently used drugs to inhibit Ang II generation or signaling, such as ACE inhibitors or Angiotensin receptor blockers, direct down-modulation of Ang II levels by rhACE2 protein is one of the promising candidates for new therapeutic strategy in cardiovascular disease and other Ang II-related diseases, e.g. ARDS. On the other hand, although mass production of rhACE2 as a protein drug costs due to requirement of mammalian cell expression systems, B38-CAP is easily prepared with E. coli expression system and is cost effective. Therapeutic efficacy and less toxicity in mouse heart failure models would warrant further investigation of B38-CAP or other microbial carboxypeptidases in disease models. Finally the principal investigator expects that treatment with ACE2-like enzyme of bacteria B38-CAP expected to work efficiently Like human ACE2 and it will save the lung cells from COVID - 19 inhibitory effect and down regulation of ACE2 because COVID-19 binds to human ACE2 and down regulates it and this receptors is very important for lung cells survival and function So ,the principal investigator also expects that B38-CAP ACE2 like enzyme may be not recognized by COVID -19 spike protein because evolutionary it is too far away from human ace2 and human ACE2 is a real receptor of COVID -19 not ACE2 like enzyme but in the same time it will make the same function of human ACE2 In another study by Sinha et al who analyzed a publicly available Connectivity Map (CMAP) dataset of pre/post transcriptomic profiles for drug treatment in cell lines for over 20,000 small molecules, isotretinoin was the strongest down-regulator of ACE 2 receptors. On the other hand, they found 6 drugs in CMAP that are currently being investigated in clinical trials for treating COVID-19 (chloroquine, thalidomide, methylprednisolone, losartan, lopinavir and ritonavir, from clinicaltrials.gov), none of which was found to significantly alter ACE2 expression (P>0.1) Moreover, another study demonstrated that isotretinoin is a Potential papain like protease (PLpro) inhibitors which is a protein encoded by SARS-CoV-2 genes and considered one of the proteins that should be targeted in COVID-19 treatment by performing target-based virtual ligand screening . So, the principal investigator expects strong inhibition of COVID - 19 infection And rescuing the lung cells from its serious attack by treating with ACE2 like enzyme and Isotretinoin||Keywords: COVID 2019 , Isotretinoin,B38-CAP , Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme , rhACE226.","COVID","No","Interventional","July 2021","October 2021","Recombinant Bacterial ACE2 receptors -like enzyme of B38-CAP (rbACE2) plus Aerosolized 13 cis retinoic acid","Combination Product","Phase 1","All","60 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment",,"Randomized","24",,

In addition most studies do not examine the effectiveness in the obese population. The manufacture has established a recommended dosage area of 13in x13in per ChloraPrep stick as well as timing from initial preparation until the practice reached its maximum antiseptic benefit.||Our current cesarean infection rate is very low, at just 1.6% over the last 12 months (September 2107-2018).

The global rise of antimicrobial resistant (AMR) organisms is a serious world health problem. With few new antimicrobial drugs on the horizon, it is imperative that we develop novel approaches to extend the service life of our existing drugs. AMR is a complex problem that is being driven by a wide range of factors. More than half of the antibiotics prescribed have no medical benefit, and outpatient visits for uncomplicated urinary tract infections (UTIs) are a major contributor to this problem. Recent studies have shown that nearly half of people treated for UTIs receive the wrong frontline drug and in 75% of patients, the duration of therapy is inappropriate. Limitations in the current diagnostic technology make it impossible to identify UTI pathogens and measure their antibiotic sensitivities during the short out-patient clinical visits that are typical for most UTI patients. These circumstances result in the inappropriate use of stronger than necessary or inappropriate antimicrobials.

Sub-therapeutic rifampicin concentrations are common in TB patients and have been demonstrated in several studies carried out among patients with tuberculosis receiving the standard dose (10mg/kg) of rifampicin. Insufficient exposure to isoniazid and rifampicin, which are the cornerstones of TB treatment, has been associated with drug resistance, treatment failure and delayed bacterial clearance from sputum. Evidence has indicated that the current dose of rifampicin (10mg/kg) is inadequate for many patients. Several studies have suggested that dose escalation (to 20-35mg/kg) is safe, and that higher doses (35mg/kg) may accelerate clearance of TB bacteria from the sputum of infected individuals and achievement of target concentrations.15,16 However, these studies have almost entirely been conducted among HIV negative TB patients, or TB-HIV co-infected patients without severe immunosuppression who are not yet receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART). TB-HIV co-infected patients on multiple additional drugs, including ART, are at increased risk of drug-drug interactions and drug related toxicities, including hepatotoxicity. Increasing the dose of rifampicin is a promising approach; however, there is paucity of data on the safety of higher doses of rifampicin in HIV infected patients on ART, and almost no information on the enzyme induction effect of high dose rifampicin on Efavirenz (EFV) and Dolutegravir (DTG). In this study, the investigators will not only evaluate for the enzyme induction effect of 35mg/kg of rifampicin on the most widely used first-line antiretrovirals, but will also look at the safety of these combinations in a population in which there is still scarce safety data.

2804,"Not yet recruiting","Transgender women (trans women; assigned male sex at birth but identify as female) are at high risk for HIV infection, and are an important, under-researched population in sub-Saharan Africa. Trans women have a 13 times greater risk of acquiring HIV than adults aged 15-49 years in the general population, and in Africa, trans women have nearly twice the HIV prevalence (25%) of men who have sex with men [MSM] (14%). Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is an effective prevention tool that could change the trajectory of the HIV epidemic among the 25 million trans women globally, yet its use has been suboptimal in this vulnerable population. Same-day PrEP initiation is feasible and acceptable and improves retention in PrEP care in resource-rich settings. Same-day initiation of emtricitabine/tenofovir alafenamide (F/TAF), a new PrEP regimen, has not to our knowledge previously been evaluated as PrEP in African trans women. F/TAF is potentially more efficacious and safer than emtricitabine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (F/TDF) as shown in the recent DISCOVER trial. However, concerns about drug-drug interactions between feminizing hormonal therapy (FHT) and PrEP are a key potential adherence barrier for trans women. While PrEP drugs do not lower FHT levels, FHT decreases plasma TFV and (emtricitabine) FTC levels. Little is known about FHT use among African trans women taking F/TAF or how concerns about F/TAF-FHT interactions may influence PrEP adherence. Moreover, interventions to support PrEP adherence in this population are needed. Feedback about PrEP use has been shown to potentially improve PrEP adherence among MSM but has not been utilized among trans women. Key knowledge gaps include: 1) whether same-day PrEP can be successfully implemented for African trans women, 2) the impact of drug-level feedback on PrEP adherence, and 3) how use of FHT may influence PrEP adherence.||To address these questions, this protocol describes a randomized trial to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of same day initiation of F/TAF PrEP, evaluate impact of drug-level feedback on PrEP adherence and characterize PrEP persistence, and in-depth interviews to explore how self-care interventions for sexual health influence prevention choices among trans women and their sexual partners. This will be the first clinical trial, to our knowledge, to evaluate F/TAF as PrEP for HIV-negative trans women in sub-Saharan Africa.","HIV|PrEP|Transgender Women|Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Bacterial","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","June 2021","December 2023","Integrated Next Steps Counseling with Real-Time Drug Level Feedback","Combination Product","Not Applicable","Male",,"14 Years","Prevention","Parallel Assignment","Uganda","Randomized","200",,

VVC usually responds well to treatment, yet a small but significant fraction of women experience recurrent yeast infections even with weekly treatment. A further complication in understanding the causes of recurrent infections is that approximately one in five females have vaginal yeast present without any symptoms at any given point. The link between fungi, other microbes in the vagina (""microbiome""), and the human immune system remain poorly understood in the switch from having yeast present in the vagina without any symptoms and symptomatic yeast infections. Fungi also compose a normal component of the microbiome at other sites in the body (e.g., oral, skin, gastrointestinal tract, rectum) where they may serve as a source of re-infection following treatment.||In addition to the commonly prescribed 'first choice' antifungal drug fluconazole, a second-line treatment, boric acid, has shown promise in the literature and has been used locally with success at increasing the time between recurrent infections. A drawback of this therapy, however, is cost, as it is a compounded medication, and patients have to pay out of pocket. The purpose of this study is to understand how the yeast and bacterial microbial communities differ for females with recurrent infections from females with their first yeast infection and females with vaginal yeast present without any symptoms, and to track yeast diversity following treatment with either boric acid or fluconazole. We hypothesize that we will identify multiple subpopulations of yeast at multiple anatomical body sites in females with VVC and recurrent VVC. We anticipate finding evidence for recurrent infection from secondary sites by linking genomic diversity of vaginal yeast strains during symptomatic infection to strains from other body sites. We hypothesize that yeast isolated from females with recurrent infections will exhibit different drug response phenotypes than yeast from females with asymptomatic vaginal yeast. We hypothesize that the vaginal microbiome of post-treatment patients treated with boric acid will differ from that of fluconazole. Combined, we hypothesize that post-treatment response will differ between the drugs, indicating that treatment specifics influence the vaginal environment.","Candidiasis, Vulvovaginal","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","September 1, 2021","August 31, 2022","Fluconazole 150 mg|Boric Acid Supp,Vag","Drug|Drug","Early Phase 1","Female","50 Years","18 Years","Basic Science","Parallel Assignment",,"Non-Randomized","105",,

After ingesting contaminated food or drink, the Salmonellae travel first to the gut, then the bloodstream, from where they can infect other parts of the body. Antibiotics are used to kill the bacteria, but with increasing rates of antibiotic resistance, this treatment is becoming less effective.||Two Salmonella variants, Typhi and Paratyphi, cause over 30 million cases of enteric fever and more than 200,000 deaths per year, mostly in developing countries. While improved hygiene and sanitation should eventually eliminate enteric fever, reduction of the disease burden in the medium term is achievable through effective vaccination.||Vaccines likely to be available for mass vaccination are effective only against those Salmonella strains that bear the Vi polysaccharide capsule protein. Strains that do not have these capsule proteins, or have no capsule, will not be affected by vaccination and could 'fill' the space vacated by the capsulated strains. Indeed, enteric fever caused by S. Paratyphi A which does not carry the Vi protein, has risen during the past decade and accounts for more than half of all cases in some areas. Thus it is important that effective vaccines are available to protect against infection by both capsulated and noncapsulated Salmonella enterica. To develop such vaccines, we need a complete understanding of the human immune response to both types, including the contribution of immunity in the gut and the bloodstream, immune response to bacterial surface proteins, and the role of antibodies. How much cross-protection there is between the types of typhoidal Salmonellae after natural infection or vaccination is not known, but this is critical to vaccine development.||This project aims to fill in the knowledge gaps highlighted, by fully characterising the infection process and immune response in enteric fever.","Typhoid Fever|Paratyphoid Fever","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Interventional","December 2014","December 30, 2021","Salmonella Typhi|Salmonella Paratyphi","Biological|Biological","Not Applicable","All","60 Years","18 Years","Basic Science","Parallel Assignment","United Kingdom","Randomized","125",,

2854,"Active, not recruiting","Typhoid fever results from infection with a bacterium called Salmonella Typhi and is a major cause of illness worldwide. It is estimated to infect 20-25 million people every year and can affect people of all ages, but is particularly common in young children. The disease is spread through contaminated food and water, and efforts to improve water quality, sanitation and hygiene will likely go a long way to reducing the global burden of disease. Unfortunately, improving access to clean water and sanitation improvements is very costly and difficult to implement on a large scale. Vaccination against typhoid fever is likely to be a cost-effective way of reducing the global disease burden. There are two vaccines currently available against typhoid fever. Whilst these vaccines provide some protection against disease (in the region of 50-70%) these vaccines are less effective in young children, who are the population group at highest risk of disease. In order to develop a new generation of typhoid vaccines it is important to have a more complete understanding of how the bacterium causes disease. In this study, the investigators are aiming to understand more about the Salmonella Typhi bacteria and how it causes disease. In particular, the investigators aim to study the importance of a toxin produced by the typhoid bacteria, called the typhoid toxin. The typhoid toxin has only recently been discovered. It is made only by the typhoid bacteria and closely related bacteria, such as paratyphoid. From studies done in the laboratory, there is evidence that the typhoid toxin is important in causing typhoid disease. It is thought that the typhoid toxin might be important in causing symptoms of typhoid disease, however the exact role of the typhoid toxin during infection in humans hasn't been studied before. Studying this might impact on the design new vaccines against typhoid.||In this study, the investigators will be undertaking a 'challenge' with two strains of the typhoid bacteria (Salmonella Typhi). This involves exposing participants to live Salmonella Typhi under defined circumstances, by asking them to swallow a solution that contains the bacteria. After the challenge the investigators closely monitor participants for a period of at least two weeks and the investigators will then treat participants with antibiotics as soon as they are diagnosed with typhoid disease. The investigators are interested in comparing the response to challenge between two strains of the typhoid bacteria that differ in the production of the typhoid toxin.

2859,"Completed","Tuberculosis (TB) is spread by airborne transmission from adults with active contiguous TB to children, especially those living in the same household. Once children are exposed and infected they are at very high risk to develop active TB - which can be lethal if not detected and treated promptly. This makes it very important to detect TB infection as soon as possible, and treat this while it is still latent or dormant. Current therapy for latent TB infection is 9 months of Isoniazid; this is very effective if taken properly but because treatment is so long many children do not finish this. Four months of Rifampin is a recommended alternative. In adults this has been shown to be safer with much higher completion rates. However the effectiveness of this treatment is unclear, and is being studied in an ongoing study. The investigators plan to compare the safety as well as the acceptability and effectiveness of 4 months Rifampin with 9 months Isoniazid (standard treatment) in children in several sites in Canada and other countries.||It is hypothesized that among children at high risk for development of active TB, intolerance/adverse events will not be worse (non-inferiority), among those randomized to 4RIF compared to those randomized to 9INH.

With the introduction of 12-doses weekly high-dose (15 mg/kg) rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP regimen), the completion rate of 3HP has be shown to be much higher than 9H. However, 4.9% to 9.1% of LTBI cases who received 3HP failed to complete treatment because of side effects.

The World Health Organization has estimated that one-third of the entire world's population carries latent TB infection. A key TB control strategy is therapy of latent TB infection (LTBI). The current standard regimen is 9 months of Isoniazid (9INH). This regimen has excellent efficacy if taken regularly, but its effectiveness is substantially reduced by poor compliance. Serious side effects, such as hepato-toxicity can occur. Three shorter alternatives have been recommended: 6 months INH (6INH), 2 months Rifampin - Pyrazinamide (2RIF-PZA) and 4 months Rifampin (4RIF). The regimen of 6INH is less efficacious than 9INH, while 2RIF-PZA has been largely abandoned because of serious toxicity. Based on some evidence in treatment of LTBI, and extrapolating from extensive experience with treatment of active TB, it is believed that 4RIF has similar efficacy as 9INH.

A double-edged sword Clinical Study||I)Part of Tuberculosis||Tuberculosis (TB) is a major infectious disease killer globally. It affected 10 million and killed 1.4 million people in 2019 alone. The predicted impact of the COVID-19 pandemic is an additional 190,000 TB deaths in 2020, and it is expected in the next 5 y that there will be up to a 20% increase in the global TB disease burden , stressing the critical need for new safe and effective drugs against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In addition, controlling multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) presents a huge public health challenge . New drug discovery could require several years with no guarantee but repurposing established may be useful to treat patients with tuberculosis . Here we demonstrate that we could utilize the crosstalk among Chicoric Acid, 13-Cis Retinoic Acid, Minocycline , and vitamin D as a novel quadrate therapy against TB.Drug-resistant tuberculosis represents a global emergency, requiring new drugs. Recently Minocycline was found to be highly potent in laboratory strains of Mycobacterium TB, and 30 drug-sensitive and multidrug/extensively drug-resistant clinical strains were susceptible to clinically attainable dosages. The lung concentration-time profiles of a 7 mg/kg/day human-equivalent minocycline dosage yielded bacterial kill rates comparable to first-line antituberculosis drugs. Extracellular bacilli were destroyed directly by minocycline. Minocycline also killed intracellular bacilli indirectly through granzyme A-driven apoptosis. Furthermore, minocycline showed dose-dependent antiinflammatory effect, suggesting that it may protect tuberculosis patients against immunopathology. A study showed that M. tuberculosis induced the expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme involved in tryptophan catabolism, in macrophages and in the lungs of animals (mice and macaque) with active disease. In a macaque model of inhalation TB, suppression of IDO activity reduced bacterial burden, pathology, and clinical signs of TB disease, leading to increased host survival. This increased protection was accompanied by increased lung T cell proliferation, induction of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue and correlates of bacterial killing . A recent study showed that Minocycline-induced significantly inhibition of IDO expression. But Minocycline-induced inhibition of IDO expression is retinoid-dependent. The combined treatment with minocycline and retinol, however, resulted in a striking, statistically significant decrease in IDO. Co-treatment with minocycline and retinol again resulted in decreased TNF-α and IL-6 levels. A study showed that IL-6 inhibits IFN-γ induced autophagy in Mycobacterium (TB) H37Rv infected macrophages. As well as neutralization of endogenous IL-6 by anti-IL-6 antibody significantly enhances the IFN-γ mediated killing of the intracellular bacteria. Minocycline's anti-inflammatory effects are mediated through RAR signaling. Therefore, The combined treatment with minocycline and retinol is expected to effectively inhibit (TB) and its inflammatory complication, Fortunately, Retinoic Acid significantly inhibits the in vivo growth of M. tuberculosis and the development of tuberculosis. In addition to, 13-Cis RA and Chicoric Acid ( CA ) enhanced the cell surface expression of HLA-DR and CD14 molecules on U937 macrophages and prevented the growth of Mtb within macrophages. Moreover, 13-cis RA and CA, have increased NO generation compared to untreated control macrophages, significantly . Both drugs have a significant inhibitory effect on Mtb growth but CA at the highest concentration was more potent than 13-cis RA . Therefore we will use retinoic acid to induce the effect of Minocycline as well as its ability to inhibit tuberculosis in combination with CA .Recent data showed that Vitamin D support innate immune responses to Mycobacterium TB and Low vitamin D levels were associated with a 5-fold increased risk for progression to tuberculosis. Deficiency of vitamin D has long been implicated in activation of (TB) . Serum vitamin D in TB patients are lower than in healthy controls . Vitamin D has been found to speed up the clearance of (TB) bacteria from the lungs of people with multi-drug resistant TB, according to a study of 1,850 patients. It was showed that Vitamin D receptor (VDR) must form a heterodimer complex with retinoid X receptor (RXR) to regulate gene transcription. Retinol plays a crucial role in lung development and signaling the vitamin D pathway. 9-cis-retinoic acid, an active vitamin A metabolite and the ligand of RXR, assists VDR signaling and suppresses the degradation of circulating vitamin D.","Tuberculosis","No","Interventional","December 2021","February 2022","13 cis retinoic acid, Minocycline, Chicroic Acid and Vitamin D for (MDR-TB)|9 cis retinoic acid, Minocycline, Chicroic Acid and Vitamin D for (MDR-TB)|All trans retinoic acid , Minocycline,Chicroic Acid and Vitamin D for (MDR-TB)|All trans retinoic acid, Minocycline, Chicroic Acid and Vitamin D For (COVID-19 and MDR-TB)|13 cis retinoic acid, Minocycline, Chicroic Acid and Vitamin D For (COVID-19 and MDR-TB)|The standard therapy","Combination Product|Combination Product|Combination Product|Combination Product|Combination Product|Other","Phase 2","All","65 Years","18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","Egypt|Saudi Arabia","Randomized","250",,

The bladder of patients with SCI, especially those who have indwelling catheters, is often colonized by bacteria that may or may not cause symptoms of UTI. Bacteria that do not cause symptoms are usually considered benign colonizers and are often left untreated because they may afford some protection against symptomatic infection with more harmful bacteria.||We applied the concept of using benign bacteria to prevent symptomatic infection, so-called bacterial interference, by deliberately colonizing the bladder of patients with SCI with a non-pathogenic prototype of Escherichia coli (strain 83972).

Despite the low overall incidence of symptomatic tuberculosis infection in low-prevalence countries, the potential mortality and morbidity mandate constant vigilance to identify patients at risk for reactivation. Due to systemic immunosuppression, immunocompromised patients with latent M. tuberculosis infection are at increased risk of progression to active disease. This applies to patients with various causes of immunodeficiency such as HIV-infected patients, allogeneic stem cell and solid organ transplant recipients, patients with rheumatoid arthritis and patients with chronic renal failure. Therefore, current guidelines aimed at preventing tuberculosis infection in immunocompromized individuals recommend a generalized screening for evidence of latent infection to target appropriate preventative prophylaxis. At present, tuberculosis control programs exclusively rely on the tuberculin skin test to identify a latent infection in asymptomatic individuals.||Recently, novel in vitro assays termed T cell interferon-gamma release assay (TIGRA) have become available that are based on the detection of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in T cells or supernatants after stimulation with highly specific antigens of M. tuberculosis.

Because of the involvement in lung injury, S1P could be the potential biomarker of pneumonia. Recently, our pilot study suggested that patients with CAP have significantly higher plasma S1P levels than healthy individuals. Interestingly, our observational study also showed significantly elevated S1P level in the patients who were treated with methylprednisolone during the hospitalization.

It is probable that several factors are involved, such as poverty, lack of education and access to healthcare. Infectious diseases constitute important threats to maternal health in resource-limited settings. Tuberculosis (TB) is reported to be the third leading cause of maternal death globally. Furthermore, TB can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy, with high risk of severe consequences for the infant. Despite these data, neither the role of TB in relation to co-existing risk factors for adverse pregnancy outcomes, nor the mechanisms involved, are well understood. It is likely that TB interacts with other characteristics, in particular socio-economic condition and HIV infection, which could obscure associations between TB and pregnancy outcomes. For this reason, it is critical to design studies so that the independent role of TB can be deduced.||This project aims to investigate how TB infection in women affects the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in relation to co-existing factors, and how exposure to TB infection may impact growth and development of infants born to women with TB. In addition, mechanisms in which TB and the immune system during pregnancy will be explored.||The project is conducted at public health facilities in Ethiopia, where 2 000 women will be recruited during antenatal care.

After an initial episode, disease recurrence is high and relapses can occur in 20-30% of people treated with oral vancomycin. An antibiotic course can affect the gut microbiome for years, and patients with CDI have additional dysbiosis of their gut flora. Oral vancomycin perturbs the gut microbiome further. Restoration of the microbiome with Fecal Microbiota Transplant (FMT) has been proven a highly efficacious and cost-effective treatment for recurrent CDI. FMT has had very limited study for a primary episode of CDI to date because an endoscopic procedure was the recommended route of delivery. However, FMT is now available via frozen oral capsules and has been shown to be non-inferior to FMT via colonoscopy in randomized controlled trials.||The investigators hypothesize that outcomes after a first episode of CDI can be improved if the microbiome is restored with oral FMT. It is further hypothesized that this will compensate for any additional microbiome perturbation caused by administration of oral vancomycin and decrease the likelihood of recurrence. Because the hypothesis is based on restoration of the microbiome, the investigators propose this proof-of-concept pilot study to examine whether FMT administered after oral vancomycin therapy for primary CDI restores microbiome diversity compared to patients who do not receive FMT. Because of the potential health benefits, this approach deserves further study. The results from this pilot study on the microbiome diversity as well as the surveys to be conducted about GI symptomatology (e.g., diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating), CDI recurrence and healthcare utilization, would provide preliminary data to support a randomized controlled, multicenter clinical trial.","Clostridium Difficile Infection","No","Interventional","August 23, 2019","January 15, 2021","Fecal microbiota transplant G3 capsules|Oral Vancomycin alone","Biological|Other","Phase 1|Phase 2","All",,"18 Years","Treatment","Parallel Assignment","United States","Non-Randomized","5",,

2988,"Enrolling by invitation","Tuberculosis (TB) has overtaken HIV as the leading infectious cause of death worldwide and requires a major policy shift for it to be controlled in line with the WHO Stop-TB goal to ""end TB"". However, how to control TB at population level in the context of HIV, is unknown. Some of the best evidence to date comes from the Southern African ZAMSTAR trial, where a household-level TB /HIV intervention including TB symptom screening, HIV counselling and testing with linkage to care and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) as indicated, was offered to all household members of TB patients. Despite only reaching ~6% of households in the intervention communities, the data showed a nearly 20% reduction in TB disease prevalence and 50% reduction in TB infection incidence at the population-level. Increasing the scope of the intervention to all households and thus all community members, may therefore significantly change the burden of TB and ""end TB"".||The proposed TREATS project builds on the experience of ZAMSTAR and is nested within the ongoing HPTN 071 (PopART) trial (NCT01900977), the largest ever trial of a combination HIV/TB prevention intervention being conducted in Zambia and South Africa. The project consists of 4 linked studies that will provide definitive cluster-randomised evidence of the effect of a household-level combined HIV and TB prevention intervention on the burden of TB at population level. The project will produce two major outputs of global importance to public health policy. The first will provide definitive evidence of the effectiveness of scaled up combination TB/HIV prevention interventions on TB. The second output will improve understanding of the best ways to measure the impact of public health interventions on TB burden.||This is a unique opportunity to assess the impact of combination HIV prevention, including universal HIV testing and treatment, combined with population screening for active TB on the burden of TB. The HPTN071(PopART) trial,a cluster randomised trial in 21 communities in Zambia and South Africa with a population size of approximately 1 million individuals, is unlikely ever to be repeated. The recently adopted WHO guidelines of a ""universal treatment"" strategy for HIV, will prompt policy-makers to seek strategies of case-finding for HIV offering an opportunity to conduct TB screening on a large scale. The results from the TREATS project will therefore provide unique and timely information of the additional costs and benefits of combined TB and HIV prevention strategies at population level.||TREATS will also assess novel methods to measure the effect of interventions on burden of TB in the trial communities. The latest interferon gamma release assay QuantiFERON® Gold Plus will be assessed for measuring impact of TB interventions on incidence of infection. A combination of Xpert® MTB/RIF and computer aided digital X-ray (CAD4TB) will be assessed for measuring prevalence of active TB. These new methods will provide important information about the best way of measuring TB incidence and prevalence rates and allow triangulation of the different methods to inform global estimates of TB burden in the post MDG era.||The TREATS consortium will stimulate synergy between leading African research groups (Zambart, HST); new European technology (Delft Diagnostic Imaging, Qiagen); international TB bodies (The Union) and European research centres (LSHTM, Imperial College, Sheffield University and KNCV), as well as with the US funders of the HPTN071/PopART trial.","Tuberculosis|HIV/AIDS","Accepts Healthy Volunteers","Observational","June 12, 2018","April 30, 2021","Combination of TB/HIV prevention activities (arm A)|Combination of TB/HIV prevention activities (arm B)|Standard of care (arm C)","Other|Other|Other",,"All",,"15 Years",,,"South Africa|Zambia",,"4200",,

2995,"Completed","Perineal injury following childbirth can result in complications such as wound infection. The perineum has closely related anatomical structures including the external genital organs and the anal triangle which contains the anal sphincter muscles. Therefore as wound infection can extend and as muscles of the perineum sit in such close proximity to each other, the anal sphincter muscles could potentially be affected. This could also potentially include cases of perineal injury where the anal sphincter was not injured.||However ultrasound has never been used to investigate this. Endoanal ultrasound is the gold standard diagnostic tool in the assessment of obstetric anal sphincter injury. The anal sphincter can also be visualised using multiplanar transperineal ultrasound(three/four-dimensional. Therefore both modalities could be used. However, it has been shown that transperineal ultrasound has a high positive predictive value and therefore is able to correctly identify an intact anal sphincter, but low positive predictive value; meaning poor detection of sphincter defects. Therefore, although it cannot completely substitute endoanal ultrasound (the gold standard in investigating obstetric anal sphincter injuries), it provides and adjunct/alternative for women who cannot tolerate endoanal ultrasound.||The investigators plan to perform an observational study to evaluate to the natural history of perineal wound infections. Patients will be assessed weekly with endoanal ultrasound and/or transperineal ultrasound until the wound infection has resolved and the wound has clinically healed.||If a bacterial wound swab has not been taken prior to recruitment or wound swab results are not available, one will be taken to detect the causative organisms.

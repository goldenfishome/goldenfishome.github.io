### Data Visualization with Stock Data

```{r ,echo=FALSE}

options("getSymbols.warning4.0"=FALSE)
options("getSymbols.yahoo.warning"=FALSE)

tickers = c("GOOGL","META","CVS" )
for (i in tickers){
  getSymbols(i,
             from = "2012-10-01",
             to = "2022-12-01")}

x <- list(
  title = "date"
)
y <- list(
  title = "value"
)

stock <- data.frame(GOOGL$GOOGL.Adjusted,
                    META$META.Adjusted,
                    CVS$CVS.Adjusted)


stock <- data.frame(stock,rownames(stock))
colnames(stock) <- append(tickers,'Dates')

stock$date<-as.Date(stock$Dates,"%Y-%m-%d")
head(stock)


```

```{r ,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(stock, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=GOOGL, colour="GOOGL"))+
  geom_line(aes(y=CVS, colour="CVS"))+
  geom_line(aes(y=META, colour="META"))+
   labs(
    title = "Stock Prices for the Tech Companies",
    subtitle = "From 2013-2022",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Adjusted Closing Prices")+
    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white", colour = "grey50"))+
    guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Tech Companies")) 

```

Hover over the plot to see the difference.

```{r ,echo=FALSE}
g4<- ggplot(stock, aes(x=date)) +
  geom_line(aes(y=GOOGL, colour="GOOGL"))+
  geom_line(aes(y=CVS, colour="CVS"))+
  geom_line(aes(y=META, colour="META"))+
   labs(
    title = "Stock Prices for the Tech Companies",
    subtitle = "From 2013-2022",
    x = "Date",
    y = "Adjusted Closing Prices")+
    guides(colour=guide_legend(title="Tech Companies")) 


ggplotly(g4) %>%
  layout(hovermode = "x")
```

This graph shows the stock price of Meta, Google and CVS from Oct 2012 to Nov 2022. GOOGLE and META have upward trend until around end of 2021. The stock price of meta plunges after Oct 2021. The technology field is have some big layoff rencent years. The stock price of CVS increases slowly after 2020, this may due to the outbreak of pandemic.

## Bitcoin plot using plotly

OR you can obtain a single stock price

```{r ,echo=FALSE}
#bitc_ALL <- getSymbols("BTC",auto.assign = FALSE, from = "2020-10-01",src="yahoo")
bitc <- getSymbols("BTC",auto.assign = FALSE, from = "2021-09-15",src="yahoo") 
head(bitc)
start(bitc)
end(bitc)
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
bitc=data.frame(bitc)
bitc <- data.frame(bitc,rownames(bitc))
head(bitc)

colnames(bitc)[7] = "date"
head(bitc)

bitc$date<-as.Date(bitc$date,"%Y-%m-%d")
str(bitc)


## ggplot
bitc %>%
  ggplot()+
  geom_line(aes(y=BTC.Adjusted,x=date),color="blue")

## plotly
fig <- plot_ly(bitc, x = ~date, y = ~BTC.Adjusted, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')

fig <- fig %>% layout(title = "Basic line Plot")
fig
```

```{r ,echo=FALSE}
#plotly
# candlestick plot

df <- tail(bitc, 30)

figc <- df %>% plot_ly(x = ~date, type="candlestick",
          open = ~BTC.Open, close = ~BTC.Close,
          high = ~BTC.High, low = ~BTC.Low) 
figc <- figc %>% layout(title = "Basic Candlestick Chart")

figc
```

4.  Plot the climate data (`climate.csv`) using plotly.

<https://plotly.com/r/>



This graph shows the daily max temperature from January 1st 2021 to September 30th 2021 from national arboretum DC. It shows both seasonality and upward trend. The max temperature rises because it starts from winter and ends at fall. Another interesting finding is that the max temperature shows flucuation around every 2 weeks,

5.  Make only the plots visible in your webpage. (set `echo=FALSE` in your R code chunck)

6.  Add interpretations to all the plots in the webpage.

So now you will only have the plots and the interpretation in the webpage. You can add titles or can be creative about the page as you want.

7.  Use a different theme than mine. More themes can be found here. <https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-themes.html>

8.  Add this to your Georgetown domain with the title "Data Vizes in TS". And submit the URL for the Lab 0 assignment.

However please remember to take it down at the end of the semester if you don't need that page on your website.

9.  Professor James will demonstrate how to push your website to GU domains from your local laptops.
